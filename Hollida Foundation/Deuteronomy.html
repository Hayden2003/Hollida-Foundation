<h1>Deuteronomy</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>The Command to Leave Sinai</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were camped in the Jordan Valley[a] near Suph, between Paran on one side and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab on the other.

<sup>2</sup> Normally it takes only eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai[b] to Kadesh-barnea, going by way of Mount Seir. <sup>3</sup> But forty years after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month,[c] Moses addressed the people of Israel, telling them everything the Lord had commanded him to say. <sup>4</sup> This took place after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated King Og of Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth.

<sup>5</sup> While the Israelites were in the land of Moab east of the Jordan River, Moses carefully explained the Lord’s instructions as follows.

<sup>6</sup> “When we were at Mount Sinai, the Lord our God said to us, ‘You have stayed at this mountain long enough. <sup>7</sup> It is time to break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western foothills,[d] the Negev, and the coastal plain. Go to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, and all the way to the great Euphrates River. <sup>8</sup> Look, I am giving all this land to you! Go in and occupy it, for it is the land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to all their descendants.’”
<br>
<i><b>Moses Appoints Leaders from Each Tribe</b></i> <br>
<sup>9</sup> Moses continued, “At that time I told you, ‘You are too great a burden for me to carry all by myself. <sup>10</sup> The Lord your God has increased your population, making you as numerous as the stars! <sup>11</sup> And may the Lord, the God of your ancestors, multiply you a thousand times more and bless you as he promised! <sup>12</sup> But you are such a heavy load to carry! How can I deal with all your problems and bickering? <sup>13</sup> Choose some well-respected men from each tribe who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’

<sup>14</sup> “Then you responded, ‘Your plan is a good one.’ <sup>15</sup> So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten.

<sup>16</sup> “At that time I instructed the judges, ‘You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you. Be perfectly fair in your decisions <sup>17</sup> and impartial in your judgments. Hear the cases of those who are poor as well as those who are rich. Don’t be afraid of anyone’s anger, for the decision you make is God’s decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you, and I will handle them.’

<sup>18</sup> “At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do.
<br>
<i><b>Scouts Explore the Land</b></i> <br>
<sup>19</sup> “Then, just as the Lord our God commanded us, we left Mount Sinai and traveled through the great and terrifying wilderness, as you yourselves remember, and headed toward the hill country of the Amorites. When we arrived at Kadesh-barnea, <sup>20</sup> I said to you, ‘You have now reached the hill country of the Amorites that the Lord our God is giving us. <sup>21</sup> Look! He has placed the land in front of you. Go and occupy it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you. Don’t be afraid! Don’t be discouraged!’

<sup>22</sup> “But you all came to me and said, ‘First, let’s send out scouts to explore the land for us. They will advise us on the best route to take and which towns we should enter.’

<sup>23</sup> “This seemed like a good idea to me, so I chose twelve scouts, one from each of your tribes. <sup>24</sup> They headed for the hill country and came to the valley of Eshcol and explored it. <sup>25</sup> They picked some of its fruit and brought it back to us. And they reported, ‘The land the Lord our God has given us is indeed a good land.’
<br>
<i><b>Israel’s Rebellion against the Lord</b></i> <br>
<sup>26</sup> “But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God and refused to go in. <sup>27</sup> You complained in your tents and said, ‘The Lord must hate us. That’s why he has brought us here from Egypt—to hand us over to the Amorites to be slaughtered. <sup>28</sup> Where can we go? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report. They tell us, “The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are, and their towns are large, with walls rising high into the sky! We even saw giants there—the descendants of Anak!”’

<sup>29</sup> “But I said to you, ‘Don’t be shocked or afraid of them! <sup>30</sup> The Lord your God is going ahead of you. He will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt. <sup>31</sup> And you saw how the Lord your God cared for you all along the way as you traveled through the wilderness, just as a father cares for his child. Now he has brought you to this place.’

<sup>32</sup> “But even after all he did, you refused to trust the Lord your God, <sup>33</sup> who goes before you looking for the best places to camp, guiding you with a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day.

<sup>34</sup> “When the Lord heard your complaining, he became very angry. So he solemnly swore, <sup>35</sup> ‘Not one of you from this wicked generation will live to see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, <sup>36</sup> except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see this land because he has followed the Lord completely. I will give to him and his descendants some of the very land he explored during his scouting mission.’

<sup>37</sup> “And the Lord was also angry with me because of you. He said to me, ‘Moses, not even you will enter the Promised Land! <sup>38</sup> Instead, your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will lead the people into the land. Encourage him, for he will lead Israel as they take possession of it. <sup>39</sup> I will give the land to your little ones—your innocent children. You were afraid they would be captured, but they will be the ones who occupy it. <sup>40</sup> As for you, turn around now and go on back through the wilderness toward the Red Sea.[e]’

<sup>41</sup> “Then you confessed, ‘We have sinned against the Lord! We will go into the land and fight for it, as the Lord our God has commanded us.’ So your men strapped on their weapons, thinking it would be easy to attack the hill country.

<sup>42</sup> “But the Lord told me to tell you, ‘Do not attack, for I am not with you. If you go ahead on your own, you will be crushed by your enemies.’

<sup>43</sup> “This is what I told you, but you would not listen. Instead, you again rebelled against the Lord’s command and arrogantly went into the hill country to fight. <sup>44</sup> But the Amorites who lived there came out against you like a swarm of bees. They chased and battered you all the way from Seir to Hormah. <sup>45</sup> Then you returned and wept before the Lord, but he refused to listen. 46 So you stayed there at Kadesh for a long time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Remembering Israel's Wanderings</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Then we turned around and headed back across the wilderness toward the Red Sea,[a] just as the Lord had instructed me, and we wandered around in the region of Mount Seir for a long time.

<sup>2</sup> “Then at last the Lord said to me, <sup>3</sup> ‘You have been wandering around in this hill country long enough; turn to the north. <sup>4</sup> Give these orders to the people: “You will pass through the country belonging to your relatives the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. The Edomites will feel threatened, so be careful. <sup>5</sup> Do not bother them, for I have given them all the hill country around Mount Seir as their property, and I will not give you even one square foot of their land. <sup>6</sup> If you need food to eat or water to drink, pay them for it. <sup>7</sup> For the Lord your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He has watched your every step through this great wilderness. During these forty years, the Lord your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.”’

<sup>8</sup> “So we bypassed the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We avoided the road through the Arabah Valley that comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber.

“Then as we turned north along the desert route through Moab, <sup>9</sup> the Lord warned us, ‘Do not bother the Moabites, the descendants of Lot, or start a war with them. I have given them Ar as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.’”

<sup>10</sup> (A race of giants called the Emites had once lived in the area of Ar. They were as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites, another race of giants. <sup>11</sup> Both the Emites and the Anakites are also known as the Rephaites, though the Moabites call them Emites. <sup>12</sup> In earlier times the Horites had lived in Seir, but they were driven out and displaced by the descendants of Esau, just as Israel drove out the people of Canaan when the Lord gave Israel their land.)

<sup>13</sup> Moses continued, “Then the Lord said to us, ‘Get moving. Cross the Zered Brook.’ So we crossed the brook.

<sup>14</sup> “Thirty-eight years passed from the time we first left Kadesh-barnea until we finally crossed the Zered Brook! By then, all the men old enough to fight in battle had died in the wilderness, as the Lord had vowed would happen. <sup>15</sup> The Lord struck them down until they had all been eliminated from the community.

<sup>16</sup> “When all the men of fighting age had died, <sup>17</sup> the Lord said to me, <sup>18</sup> ‘Today you will cross the border of Moab at Ar <sup>19</sup> and enter the land of the Ammonites, the descendants of Lot. But do not bother them or start a war with them. I have given the land of Ammon to them as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.’”

<sup>20</sup> (That area was once considered the land of the Rephaites, who had lived there, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummites. <sup>21</sup> They were also as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the Lord destroyed them so the Ammonites could occupy their land. <sup>22</sup> He had done the same for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, for he destroyed the Horites so they could settle there in their place. The descendants of Esau live there to this day. <sup>23</sup> A similar thing happened when the Caphtorites from Crete[b] invaded and destroyed the Avvites, who had lived in villages in the area of Gaza.)

<sup>24</sup> Moses continued, “Then the Lord said, ‘Now get moving! Cross the Arnon Gorge. Look, I will hand over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and I will give you his land. Attack him and begin to occupy the land. <sup>25</sup> Beginning today I will make people throughout the earth terrified because of you. When they hear reports about you, they will tremble with dread and fear.’”
<br>
<i><b>Victory over Sihon of Heshbon</b></i> <br>
<sup>26</sup> Moses continued, “From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent ambassadors to King Sihon of Heshbon with this proposal of peace:

<sup>27</sup> ‘Let us travel through your land. We will stay on the main road and won’t turn off into the fields on either side. <sup>28</sup> Sell us food to eat and water to drink, and we will pay for it. All we want is permission to pass through your land. <sup>29</sup> The descendants of Esau who live in Seir allowed us to go through their country, and so did the Moabites, who live in Ar. Let us pass through until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.’

<sup>30</sup> “But King Sihon of Heshbon refused to allow us to pass through, because the Lord your God made Sihon stubborn and defiant so he could help you defeat him, as he has now done.

<sup>31</sup> “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Look, I have begun to hand King Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to conquer and occupy his land.’

<sup>32</sup> “Then King Sihon declared war on us and mobilized his forces at Jahaz. <sup>33</sup> But the Lord our God handed him over to us, and we crushed him, his sons, and all his people. <sup>34</sup> We conquered all his towns and completely destroyed[c] everyone—men, women, and children. Not a single person was spared. <sup>35</sup>We took all the livestock as plunder for ourselves, along with anything of value from the towns we ransacked.

<sup>36</sup> “The Lord our God also helped us conquer Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and the town in the gorge, and the whole area as far as Gilead. No town had walls too strong for us. <sup>37</sup> However, we avoided the land of the Ammonites all along the Jabbok River and the towns in the hill country—all the places the Lord our God had commanded us to leave alone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Victory over Og of Bashan</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan, where King Og and his entire army attacked us at Edrei. <sup>2</sup> But the Lord told me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I have given you victory over Og and his entire army, and I will give you all his land. Treat him just as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.’

<sup>3</sup> “So the Lord our God handed King Og and all his people over to us, and we killed them all. Not a single person survived. <sup>4</sup> We conquered all sixty of his towns—the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest. <sup>5</sup> These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also took many unwalled villages at the same time. <sup>6</sup> We completely destroyed[a] the kingdom of Bashan, just as we had destroyed King Sihon of Heshbon. We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered—men, women, and children alike. <sup>7</sup> But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns.

<sup>8</sup> “So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon. <sup>9</sup> (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.) <sup>10</sup> We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup>11</sup> (King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide.[b] It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)
<br>
<i><b>Land Division East of the Jordan</b></i> <br>
<sup>12</sup> “When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns. <sup>13</sup> Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan—Og’s former kingdom—to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites. <sup>14</sup> Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair renamed this region after himself, calling it the Towns of Jair,[c] as it is still known today.) <sup>15</sup> I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir. <sup>16</sup> But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The area I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier. <sup>17</sup> They also received the Jordan Valley, all the way from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea,[d] with the Jordan River serving as the western boundary. To the east were the slopes of Pisgah.

<sup>18</sup> “At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of the Jordan: ‘Although the Lord your God has given you this land as your property, all your fighting men must cross the Jordan ahead of your Israelite relatives, armed and ready to assist them. <sup>19</sup> Your wives, children, and numerous livestock, however, may stay behind in the towns I have given you. <sup>20</sup> When the Lord has given security to the rest of the Israelites, as he has to you, and when they occupy the land the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan River, then you may all return here to the land I have given you.’
<br>
<i><b>Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land</b></i> <br>
<sup>21</sup> “At that time I gave Joshua this charge: ‘You have seen for yourself everything the Lord your God has done to these two kings. He will do the same to all the kingdoms on the west side of the Jordan. <sup>22</sup> Do not be afraid of the nations there, for the Lord your God will fight for you.’

<sup>23</sup> “At that time I pleaded with the Lord and said, <sup>24</sup> ‘O Sovereign Lord, you have only begun to show your greatness and the strength of your hand to me, your servant. Is there any god in heaven or on earth who can perform such great and mighty deeds as you do? <sup>25</sup> Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains.’

<sup>26</sup> “But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. ‘That’s enough!’ he declared. ‘Speak of it no more. <sup>27</sup> But go up to Pisgah Peak, and look over the land in every direction. Take a good look, but you may not cross the Jordan River. <sup>28</sup> Instead, commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead the people across the Jordan. He will give them all the land you now see before you as their possession.’ <sup>29</sup> So we stayed in the valley near Beth-peor.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Moses Urges Israel to Obey</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“And now, Israel, listen carefully to these decrees and regulations that I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you may live, so you may enter and occupy the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. <sup>2</sup> Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you.

<sup>3</sup> “You saw for yourself what the Lord did to you at Baal-peor. There the Lord your God destroyed everyone who had worshiped Baal, the god of Peor. <sup>4</sup> But all of you who were faithful to the Lord your God are still alive today—every one of you.

<sup>5</sup> “Look, I now teach you these decrees and regulations just as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy. <sup>6</sup> Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence among the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim, ‘How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!’ <sup>7</sup> For what great nation has a god as near to them as the Lord our God is near to us whenever we call on him? <sup>8</sup> And what great nation has decrees and regulations as righteous and fair as this body of instructions that I am giving you today?

<sup>9</sup> “But watch out! Be careful never to forget what you yourself have seen. Do not let these memories escape from your mind as long as you live! And be sure to pass them on to your children and grandchildren. <sup>10</sup> Never forget the day when you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Sinai,[a] where he told me, ‘Summon the people before me, and I will personally instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live, and they will teach their children to fear me also.’

<sup>11</sup> “You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while flames from the mountain shot into the sky. The mountain was shrouded in black clouds and deep darkness. <sup>12</sup> And the Lord spoke to you from the heart of the fire. You heard the sound of his words but didn’t see his form; there was only a voice. <sup>13</sup> He proclaimed his covenant—the Ten Commandments[b]—which he commanded you to keep, and which he wrote on two stone tablets. <sup>14</sup> It was at that time that the Lord commanded me to teach you his decrees and regulations so you would obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy.
<br>
<i><b>A Warning against Idolatry</b></i> <br>
<sup>15</sup> “But be very careful! You did not see the Lord’s form on the day he spoke to you from the heart of the fire at Mount Sinai. <sup>16</sup> So do not corrupt yourselves by making an idol in any form—whether of a man or a woman, <sup>17</sup> an animal on the ground, a bird in the sky, <sup>18</sup> a small animal that scurries along the ground, or a fish in the deepest sea. <sup>19</sup> And when you look up into the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars—all the forces of heaven—don’t be seduced into worshiping them. The Lord your God gave them to all the peoples of the earth. <sup>20</sup> Remember that the Lord rescued you from the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt in order to make you his very own people and his special possession, which is what you are today.

<sup>21</sup> “But the Lord was angry with me because of you. He vowed that I would not cross the Jordan River into the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession. <sup>22</sup> You will cross the Jordan to occupy the land, but I will not. Instead, I will die here on the east side of the river. <sup>23</sup> So be careful not to break the covenant the Lord your God has made with you. Do not make idols of any shape or form, for the Lord your God has forbidden this. <sup>24</sup> The Lord your God is a devouring fire; he is a jealous God.

<sup>25</sup> “In the future, when you have children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time, do not corrupt yourselves by making idols of any kind. This is evil in the sight of the Lord your God and will arouse his anger.

<sup>26</sup> “Today I call on heaven and earth as witnesses against you. If you break my covenant, you will quickly disappear from the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy. You will live there only a short time; then you will be utterly destroyed. <sup>27</sup> For the Lord will scatter you among the nations, where only a few of you will survive. <sup>28</sup> There, in a foreign land, you will worship idols made from wood and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. <sup>29</sup> But from there you will search again for the Lord your God. And if you search for him with all your heart and soul, you will find him.

<sup>30</sup> “In the distant future, when you are suffering all these things, you will finally return to the Lord your God and listen to what he tells you. <sup>31</sup> For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the solemn covenant he made with your ancestors.
<br>
<i><b>There Is Only One God</b></i> <br>
<sup>32</sup> “Now search all of history, from the time God created people on the earth until now, and search from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything as great as this ever been seen or heard before? <sup>33</sup> Has any nation ever heard the voice of God[c] speaking from fire—as you did—and survived? <sup>34</sup> Has any other god dared to take a nation for himself out of another nation by means of trials, miraculous signs, wonders, war, a strong hand, a powerful arm, and terrifying acts? Yet that is what the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, right before your eyes.

<sup>35</sup> “He showed you these things so you would know that the Lord is God and there is no other. <sup>36</sup> He let you hear his voice from heaven so he could instruct you. He let you see his great fire here on earth so he could speak to you from it. <sup>37</sup> Because he loved your ancestors, he chose to bless their descendants, and he personally brought you out of Egypt with a great display of power. <sup>38</sup> He drove out nations far greater than you, so he could bring you in and give you their land as your special possession, as it is today.

<sup>39</sup> “So remember this and keep it firmly in mind: The Lord is God both in heaven and on earth, and there is no other. <sup>40</sup> If you obey all the decrees and commands I am giving you today, all will be well with you and your children. I am giving you these instructions so you will enjoy a long life in the land the Lord your God is giving you for all time.”
<br>
<i><b>Eastern Cities of Refuge</b></i> <br>
<sup>41</sup> Then Moses set apart three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River. <sup>42</sup> Anyone who killed another person unintentionally, without previous hostility, could flee there to live in safety. <sup>43</sup> These were the cities: Bezer on the wilderness plateau for the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad; Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
<br>
<i><b>Introduction to Moses’ Second Address</b></i> <br>
<sup>44</sup> This is the body of instruction that Moses presented to the Israelites. <sup>45</sup> These are the laws, decrees, and regulations that Moses gave to the people of Israel when they left Egypt, <sup>46</sup> and as they camped in the valley near Beth-peor east of the Jordan River. (This land was formerly occupied by the Amorites under King Sihon, who ruled from Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites destroyed him and his people when they came up from Egypt. <sup>47</sup> Israel took possession of his land and that of King Og of Bashan—the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. <sup>48</sup> So Israel conquered the entire area from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon Gorge all the way to Mount Sirion,[d] also called Mount Hermon. <sup>49</sup> And they conquered the eastern bank of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea,[e] below the slopes of Pisgah.)</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>The Ten Commandments</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>Moses called all the people of Israel together and said, “Listen carefully, Israel. Hear the decrees and regulations I am giving you today, so you may learn them and obey them!

<sup>2</sup> “The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Sinai.[a] <sup>3</sup> The Lord did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of us who are alive today. <sup>4</sup> At the mountain the Lord spoke to you face to face from the heart of the fire. <sup>5</sup> I stood as an intermediary between you and the Lord, for you were afraid of the fire and did not want to approach the mountain. He spoke to me, and I passed his words on to you. This is what he said:

<sup>6</sup> “I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery.

<sup>7</sup> “You must not have any other god but me.

<sup>8</sup> “You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. <sup>9</sup> You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. <sup>10</sup> But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those[b] who love me and obey my commands.

<sup>11</sup> “You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name.

<sup>12</sup> “Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. <sup>13</sup> You have six days each week for your ordinary work, <sup>14</sup> but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys and other livestock, and any foreigners living among you. All your male and female servants must rest as you do. <sup>15</sup> Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out with his strong hand and powerful arm. That is why the Lord your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day.

<sup>16</sup> “Honor your father and mother, as the Lord your God commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

<sup>17</sup> “You must not murder.

<sup>18</sup> “You must not commit adultery.

<sup>19</sup> “You must not steal.

<sup>20</sup> “You must not testify falsely against your neighbor.

<sup>21</sup> “You must not covet your neighbor’s wife. You must not covet your neighbor’s house or land, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.

<sup>22</sup> “The Lord spoke these words to all of you assembled there at the foot of the mountain. He spoke with a loud voice from the heart of the fire, surrounded by clouds and deep darkness. This was all he said at that time, and he wrote his words on two stone tablets and gave them to me.

<sup>23</sup> “But when you heard the voice from the heart of the darkness, while the mountain was blazing with fire, all your tribal leaders and elders came to me. <sup>24</sup> They said, ‘Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice from the heart of the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak to us humans, and yet we live! <sup>25</sup> But now, why should we risk death again? If the Lord our God speaks to us again, we will certainly die and be consumed by this awesome fire. <sup>26</sup> Can any living thing hear the voice of the living God from the heart of the fire as we did and yet survive? <sup>27</sup> Go yourself and listen to what the Lord our God says. Then come and tell us everything he tells you, and we will listen and obey.’

<sup>28</sup> “The Lord heard the request you made to me. And he said, ‘I have heard what the people said to you, and they are right. <sup>29</sup> Oh, that they would always have hearts like this, that they might fear me and obey all my commands!

If you obey all his decrees and commands, you will enjoy a long life. <sup>3</sup> Listen closely, Israel, and be careful to obey. Then all will go well with you, and you will have many children in the land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.

It is a land with large, prosperous cities that you did not build. <sup>11</sup> The houses will be richly stocked with goods you did not produce.

When you take an oath, you must use only his name.

<sup>14</sup> “You must not worship any of the gods of neighboring nations, <sup>15</sup> for the Lord your God, who lives among you, is a jealous God. His anger will flare up against you, and he will wipe you from the face of the earth. <sup>16</sup> You must not test the Lord your God as you did when you complained at Massah. <sup>17</sup> You must diligently obey the commands of the Lord your God—all the laws and decrees he has given you. <sup>18</sup> Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so all will go well with you.

<sup>20</sup> “In the future your children will ask you, ‘What is the meaning of these laws, decrees, and regulations that the Lord our God has commanded us to obey?’

<sup>21</sup> “Then you must tell them, ‘We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with his strong hand. <sup>22</sup> The Lord did miraculous signs and wonders before our eyes, dealing terrifying blows against Egypt and Pharaoh and all his people. <sup>23</sup> He brought us out of Egypt so he could give us this land he had sworn to give our ancestors. <sup>24</sup> And the Lord our God commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear him so he can continue to bless us and preserve our lives, as he has done to this day. <sup>25</sup> For we will be counted as righteous when we obey all the commands the Lord our God has given us.’</p>

<p class="top-container"><i><b>The Privilege of Holiness</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are about to enter and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of you: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you. <sup>2</sup> When the Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy[a] them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy. <sup>3</sup> You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters, <sup>4</sup> for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you. <sup>5</sup> This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols. <sup>6</sup> For you are a holy people, who belong to the Lord your God. Of all the people on earth, the Lord your God has chosen you to be his own special treasure.

<sup>7</sup> “The Lord did not set his heart on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other nations, for you were the smallest of all nations! <sup>8</sup> Rather, it was simply that the Lord loves you, and he was keeping the oath he had sworn to your ancestors. That is why the Lord rescued you with such a strong hand from your slavery and from the oppressive hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. <sup>9</sup> Understand, therefore, that the Lord your God is indeed God. He is the faithful God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing love on those who love him and obey his commands. <sup>10</sup> But he does not hesitate to punish and destroy those who reject him. <sup>11</sup> Therefore, you must obey all these commands, decrees, and regulations I am giving you today.

<sup>12</sup> “If you listen to these regulations and faithfully obey them, the Lord your God will keep his covenant of unfailing love with you, as he promised with an oath to your ancestors. <sup>13</sup> He will love you and bless you, and he will give you many children. He will give fertility to your land and your animals. When you arrive in the land he swore to give your ancestors, you will have large harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and great herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. <sup>14</sup> You will be blessed above all the nations of the earth. None of your men or women will be childless, and all your livestock will bear young. <sup>15</sup> And the Lord will protect you from all sickness. He will not let you suffer from the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all your enemies!

<sup>16</sup> “You must destroy all the nations the Lord your God hands over to you. Show them no mercy, and do not worship their gods, or they will trap you. <sup>17</sup> Perhaps you will think to yourselves, ‘How can we ever conquer these nations that are so much more powerful than we are?’ <sup>18</sup> But don’t be afraid of them! Just remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all the land of Egypt. <sup>19</sup> Remember the great terrors the Lord your God sent against them. You saw it all with your own eyes! And remember the miraculous signs and wonders, and the strong hand and powerful arm with which he brought you out of Egypt. The Lord your God will use this same power against all the people you fear. <sup>20</sup> And then the Lord your God will send terror[b] to drive out the few survivors still hiding from you!

<sup>21</sup> “No, do not be afraid of those nations, for the Lord your God is among you, and he is a great and awesome God. <sup>22</sup> The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little.

<sup>25</sup> “You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you, for it is detestable to the Lord your God. <sup>26</sup> Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be destroyed, just like them.

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>A Call to Remember and Obey</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will live and multiply, and you will enter and occupy the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors. <sup>2</sup> Remember how the Lord your God led you through the wilderness for these forty years, humbling you and testing you to prove your character, and to find out whether or not you would obey his commands. <sup>3</sup> Yes, he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna, a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors. He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. <sup>4</sup> For all these forty years your clothes didn’t wear out, and your feet didn’t blister or swell. <sup>5</sup> Think about it: Just as a parent disciplines a child, the Lord your God disciplines you for your own good.

<sup>6</sup> “So obey the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and fearing him. <sup>7</sup> For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land of flowing streams and pools of water, with fountains and springs that gush out in the valleys and hills. <sup>8</sup> It is a land of wheat and barley; of grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates; of olive oil and honey. <sup>9</sup> It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking. It is a land where iron is as common as stone, and copper is abundant in the hills. <sup>10</sup> When you have eaten your fill, be sure to praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.

<sup>11</sup> “But that is the time to be careful! Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the Lord your God and disobey his commands, regulations, and decrees that I am giving you today. <sup>12</sup> For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in, <sup>13</sup> and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver and gold have multiplied along with everything else, be careful! <sup>14</sup> Do not become proud at that time and forget the Lord your God, who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt. <sup>15</sup> Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, where it was so hot and dry. He gave you water from the rock! <sup>16</sup> He fed you with manna in the wilderness, a food unknown to your ancestors. He did this to humble you and test you for your own good. <sup>17</sup> He did all this so you would never say to yourself, ‘I have achieved this wealth with my own strength and energy.’ <sup>18</sup> Remember the Lord your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful, in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath.

<sup>19</sup> “But I assure you of this: If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods, worshiping and bowing down to them, you will certainly be destroyed. <sup>20</sup> Just as the Lord has destroyed other nations in your path, you also will be destroyed if you refuse to obey the Lord your God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Victory by God's Grace</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Listen, O Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River to take over the land belonging to nations much greater and more powerful than you. They live in cities with walls that reach to the sky! <sup>2</sup> The people are strong and tall—descendants of the famous Anakite giants. You’ve heard the saying, ‘Who can stand up to the Anakites?’ <sup>3</sup> But recognize today that the Lord your God is the one who will cross over ahead of you like a devouring fire to destroy them. He will subdue them so that you will quickly conquer them and drive them out, just as the Lord has promised.

<sup>4</sup> “After the Lord your God has done this for you, don’t say in your hearts, ‘The Lord has given us this land because we are such good people!’ No, it is because of the wickedness of the other nations that he is pushing them out of your way. <sup>5</sup> It is not because you are so good or have such integrity that you are about to occupy their land. The Lord your God will drive these nations out ahead of you only because of their wickedness, and to fulfill the oath he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <sup>6</sup> You must recognize that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land because you are good, for you are not—you are a stubborn people.
<br>
<i><b>Remembering the Gold Calf</b></i> <br>
<sup>7</sup> “Remember and never forget how angry you made the Lord your God out in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until now, you have been constantly rebelling against him. <sup>8</sup> Even at Mount Sinai[a] you made the Lord so angry he was ready to destroy you. <sup>9</sup> This happened when I was on the mountain receiving the tablets of stone inscribed with the words of the covenant that the Lord had made with you. I was there for forty days and forty nights, and all that time I ate no food and drank no water. <sup>10</sup> The Lord gave me the two tablets on which God had written with his own finger all the words he had spoken to you from the heart of the fire when you were assembled at the mountain.

<sup>11</sup> “At the end of the forty days and nights, the Lord handed me the two stone tablets inscribed with the words of the covenant. <sup>12</sup> Then the Lord said to me, ‘Get up! Go down immediately, for the people you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted gold and made an idol for themselves!’

<sup>13</sup> “The Lord also said to me, ‘I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these people are. <sup>14</sup> Leave me alone so I may destroy them and erase their name from under heaven. Then I will make a mighty nation of your descendants, a nation larger and more powerful than they are.’

<sup>15</sup> “So while the mountain was blazing with fire I turned and came down, holding in my hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant. <sup>16</sup> There below me I could see that you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had melted gold and made a calf idol for yourselves. How quickly you had turned away from the path the Lord had commanded you to follow! <sup>17</sup> So I took the stone tablets and threw them to the ground, smashing them before your eyes.

<sup>18</sup> “Then, as before, I threw myself down before the Lord for forty days and nights. I ate no bread and drank no water because of the great sin you had committed by doing what the Lord hated, provoking him to anger. <sup>19</sup> I feared that the furious anger of the Lord, which turned him against you, would drive him to destroy you. But again he listened to me. <sup>20</sup> The Lord was so angry with Aaron that he wanted to destroy him, too. But I prayed for Aaron, and the Lord spared him. <sup>21</sup> I took your sin—the calf you had made—and I melted it down in the fire and ground it into fine dust. Then I threw the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain.

<sup>22</sup> “You also made the Lord angry at Taberah,[b] Massah,[c] and Kibroth-hattaavah.[d] <sup>23</sup> And at Kadesh-barnea the Lord sent you out with this command: ‘Go up and take over the land I have given you.’ But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God and refused to put your trust in him or obey him. <sup>24</sup> Yes, you have been rebelling against the Lord as long as I have known you.

<sup>25</sup> “That is why I threw myself down before the Lord for forty days and nights—for the Lord said he would destroy you. <sup>26</sup> I prayed to the Lord and said, ‘O Sovereign Lord, do not destroy them. They are your own people. They are your special possession, whom you redeemed from Egypt by your mighty power and your strong hand. <sup>27</sup> Please overlook the stubbornness and the awful sin of these people, and remember instead your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <sup>28</sup> If you destroy these people, the Egyptians will say, “The Israelites died because the Lord wasn’t able to bring them to the land he had promised to give them.” Or they might say, “He destroyed them because he hated them; he deliberately took them into the wilderness to slaughter them.” <sup>29</sup> But they are your people and your special possession, whom you brought out of Egypt by your great strength and powerful arm.’</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>New Tablets of Stone</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones. Also make a wooden Ark—a sacred chest to store them in. Come up to me on the mountain, <sup>2</sup> and I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the ones you smashed. Then place the tablets in the Ark.’

<sup>3</sup> “So I made an Ark of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first two. Then I went up the mountain with the tablets in my hand. <sup>4</sup> Once again the Lord wrote the Ten Commandments[a] on the tablets and gave them to me. They were the same words the Lord had spoken to you from the heart of the fire on the day you were assembled at the foot of the mountain. <sup>5</sup> Then I turned and came down the mountain and placed the tablets in the Ark of the Covenant, which I had made, just as the Lord commanded me. And the tablets are still there in the Ark.”

<sup>6</sup> (The people of Israel set out from the wells of the people of Jaakan[b] and traveled to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried. His son Eleazar ministered as high priest in his place. <sup>7</sup> Then they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from there to Jotbathah, a land with many brooks and streams. <sup>8</sup> At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and to stand before the Lord as his ministers, and to pronounce blessings in his name. These are their duties to this day. <sup>9</sup> That is why the Levites have no share of property or possession of land among the other Israelite tribes. The Lord himself is their special possession, as the Lord your God told them.)

<sup>10</sup> “As for me, I stayed on the mountain in the Lord’s presence for forty days and nights, as I had done the first time. And once again the Lord listened to my pleas and agreed not to destroy you. <sup>11</sup> Then the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and resume the journey, and lead the people to the land I swore to give to their ancestors, so they may take possession of it.’

<i><b>A Call to Love and Obedience</b></i> <br>

<sup>14</sup> “Look, the highest heavens and the earth and everything in it all belong to the Lord your God. <sup>15</sup> Yet the Lord chose your ancestors as the objects of his love. And he chose you, their descendants, above all other nations, as is evident today. <sup>16</sup> Therefore, change your hearts[c] and stop being stubborn.

<sup>17</sup> “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the great God, the mighty and awesome God, who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed. <sup>18</sup> He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. <sup>19</sup> So you, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. <sup>20</sup> You must fear the Lord your God and worship him and cling to him. Your oaths must be in his name alone. <sup>21</sup> He alone is your God, the only one who is worthy of your praise, the one who has done these mighty miracles that you have seen with your own eyes. <sup>22</sup> When your ancestors went down into Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky!</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

He destroyed them, and they have not recovered to this very day!

<sup>5</sup> “Your children didn’t see how the Lord cared for you in the wilderness until you arrived here. <sup>6</sup> They didn’t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram (the sons of Eliab, a descendant of Reuben) when the earth opened its mouth in the Israelite camp and swallowed them, along with their households and tents and every living thing that belonged to them. <sup>7</sup> But you have seen the Lord perform all these mighty deeds with your own eyes!

He watches over it through each season of the year!

<sup>13</sup> “If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today, and if you love the Lord your God and serve him with all your heart and soul, <sup>14</sup> then he will send the rains in their proper seasons—the early and late rains—so you can bring in your harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil. <sup>15</sup> He will give you lush pastureland for your livestock, and you yourselves will have all you want to eat.

<sup>16</sup> “But be careful. Don’t let your heart be deceived so that you turn away from the Lord and serve and worship other gods. <sup>17</sup> If you do, the Lord’s anger will burn against you.

Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him. <sup>5</sup> The false prophets or visionaries who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the Lord your God, who redeemed you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt. Since they try to lead you astray from the way the Lord your God commanded you to live, you must put them to death. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.

<sup>6</sup> “Suppose someone secretly entices you—even your brother, your son or daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend—and says, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known. <sup>7</sup> They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby or who come from the ends of the earth. <sup>8</sup> But do not give in or listen. Have no pity, and do not spare or protect them. <sup>9</sup> You must put them to death! Strike the first blow yourself, and then all the people must join in. <sup>10</sup> Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away from the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery. <sup>11</sup> Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid, and no one will act so wickedly again.

<sup>12</sup> “When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you, you may hear <sup>13</sup> that scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying, ‘Let us go worship other gods’—gods you have not known before. <sup>14</sup> In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you, <sup>15</sup> you must attack that town and completely destroy[b] all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. <sup>16</sup> Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. <sup>17</sup> Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.

<sup>18</sup> “The Lord your God will be merciful only if you listen to his voice and keep all his commands that I am giving you today, doing what pleases him.</p>

<p class="top-container"><i><b>Ceremonially Clean and Unclean Animals</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Since you are the people of the Lord your God, never cut yourselves or shave the hair above your foreheads in mourning for the dead. <sup>2</sup> You have been set apart as holy to the Lord your God, and he has chosen you from all the nations of the earth to be his own special treasure.

<sup>3</sup> “You must not eat any detestable animals that are ceremonially unclean. <sup>4</sup> These are the animals[a] you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, <sup>5</sup> the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the addax, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.

<sup>6</sup> “You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud, <sup>7</sup> but if the animal doesn’t have both, it may not be eaten. So you may not eat the camel, the hare, or the hyrax.[b] They chew the cud but do not have split hooves, so they are ceremonially unclean for you. <sup>8</sup> And you may not eat the pig. It has split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses.

<sup>9</sup> “Of all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales. <sup>10</sup> You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you.

<sup>11</sup> “You may eat any bird that is ceremonially clean. <sup>12</sup> These are the birds you may not eat: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, <sup>13</sup> the kite, the falcon, buzzards of all kinds, <sup>14</sup> ravens of all kinds, <sup>15</sup> the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds, <sup>16</sup> the little owl, the great owl, the barn owl, <sup>17</sup> the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, the cormorant, <sup>18</sup> the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat.

<sup>19</sup> “All winged insects that walk along the ground are ceremonially unclean for you and may not be eaten. <sup>20</sup> But you may eat any winged bird or insect that is ceremonially clean.

<sup>21</sup> “You must not eat anything that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, or you may sell it to a stranger. But do not eat it yourselves, for you are set apart as holy to the Lord your God.

“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
<br>
<i><b>The Giving of Tithes</b></i> <br>
<sup>22</sup> “You must set aside a tithe of your crops—one-tenth of all the crops you harvest each year. <sup>23</sup> Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship—the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored—and eat it there in his presence. This applies to your tithes of grain, new wine, olive oil, and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. Doing this will teach you always to fear the Lord your God.

<sup>24</sup> “Now when the Lord your God blesses you with a good harvest, the place of worship he chooses for his name to be honored might be too far for you to bring the tithe. <sup>25</sup> If so, you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds, put the money in a pouch, and go to the place the Lord your God has chosen. <sup>26</sup> When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want—cattle, sheep, goats, wine, or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the Lord your God and celebrate with your household. <sup>27</sup> And do not neglect the Levites in your town, for they will receive no allotment of land among you.

<sup>28</sup> “At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year’s harvest and store it in the nearest town. <sup>29</sup> Give it to the Levites, who will receive no allotment of land among you, as well as to the foreigners living among you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Release for Debtors</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“At the end of every seventh year you must cancel the debts of everyone who owes you money. <sup>2</sup> This is how it must be done. Everyone must cancel the loans they have made to their fellow Israelites. They must not demand payment from their neighbors or relatives, for the Lord’s time of release has arrived. <sup>3</sup> This release from debt, however, applies only to your fellow Israelites—not to the foreigners living among you.

<sup>4</sup> “There should be no poor among you, for the Lord your God will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you as a special possession. <sup>5</sup> You will receive this blessing if you are careful to obey all the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today. <sup>6</sup> The Lord your God will bless you as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations but will never need to borrow. You will rule many nations, but they will not rule over you.

<sup>7</sup> “But if there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward them. <sup>8</sup> Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need. <sup>9</sup> Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year for canceling debts is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the Lord, you will be considered guilty of sin. <sup>10</sup> Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do. <sup>11</sup> There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.
<br>
<i><b>Release for Hebrew Slaves</b></i> <br>
<sup>12</sup> “If a fellow Hebrew sells himself or herself to be your servant[a] and serves you for six years, in the seventh year you must set that servant free.

<sup>13</sup> “When you release a male servant, do not send him away empty-handed. <sup>14</sup> Give him a generous farewell gift from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. Share with him some of the bounty with which the Lord your God has blessed you. <sup>15</sup> Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you! That is why I am giving you this command.

<sup>16</sup> “But suppose your servant says, ‘I will not leave you,’ because he loves you and your family, and he has done well with you. <sup>17</sup> In that case, take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door. After that, he will be your servant for life. And do the same for your female servants.

<sup>18</sup> “You must not consider it a hardship when you release your servants. Remember that for six years they have given you services worth double the wages of hired workers, and the Lord your God will bless you in all you do.
<br>
<i><b>Sacrificing Firstborn Male Animals</b></i> <br>
<sup>19</sup> “You must set aside for the Lord your God all the firstborn males from your flocks and herds. Do not use the firstborn of your herds to work your fields, and do not shear the firstborn of your flocks. <sup>20</sup> Instead, you and your family must eat these animals in the presence of the Lord your God each year at the place he chooses. <sup>21</sup> But if this firstborn animal has any defect, such as lameness or blindness, or if anything else is wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. <sup>22</sup> Instead, use it for food for your family in your hometown. Anyone, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat it, just as anyone may eat a gazelle or deer. <sup>23</sup> But you must not consume the blood. You must pour it out on the ground like water.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“In honor of the Lord your God, celebrate the Passover each year in the early spring, in the month of Abib,[a] for that was the month in which the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night. <sup>2</sup> Your Passover sacrifice may be from either the flock or the herd, and it must be sacrificed to the Lord your God at the designated place of worship—the place he chooses for his name to be honored. <sup>3</sup> Eat it with bread made without yeast. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, as when you escaped from Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this bread—the bread of suffering—so that as long as you live you will remember the day you departed from Egypt. <sup>4</sup> Let no yeast be found in any house throughout your land for those seven days. And when you sacrifice the Passover lamb on the evening of the first day, do not let any of the meat remain until the next morning.

<sup>5</sup> “You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of the towns that the Lord your God is giving you. <sup>6</sup> You must offer it only at the designated place of worship—the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored. Sacrifice it there in the evening as the sun goes down on the anniversary of your exodus from Egypt. <sup>7</sup> Roast the lamb and eat it in the place the Lord your God chooses. Then you may go back to your tents the next morning. <sup>8</sup> For the next six days you may not eat any bread made with yeast. On the seventh day proclaim another holy day in honor of the Lord your God, and no work may be done on that day.
<br>
<i><b>The Festival of Harvest<?b></i> <br>
<sup>9</sup> “Count off seven weeks from when you first begin to cut the grain at the time of harvest. <sup>10</sup> Then celebrate the Festival of Harvest[b] to honor the Lord your God. Bring him a voluntary offering in proportion to the blessings you have received from him. <sup>11</sup> This is a time to celebrate before the Lord your God at the designated place of worship he will choose for his name to be honored. Celebrate with your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites from your towns, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live among you. <sup>12</sup> Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, so be careful to obey all these decrees.
<br>
<i><b>The Festival of Shelters</b></i> <br>
<sup>13</sup> “You must observe the Festival of Shelters[c] for seven days at the end of the harvest season, after the grain has been threshed and the grapes have been pressed. <sup>14</sup> This festival will be a happy time of celebrating with your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows from your towns. <sup>15</sup> For seven days you must celebrate this festival to honor the Lord your God at the place he chooses, for it is he who blesses you with bountiful harvests and gives you success in all your work. This festival will be a time of great joy for all.

<sup>16</sup> “Each year every man in Israel must celebrate these three festivals: the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters. On each of these occasions, all men must appear before the Lord your God at the place he chooses, but they must not appear before the Lord without a gift for him. <sup>17</sup> All must give as they are able, according to the blessings given to them by the Lord your God.
<br>
<i><b>Justice for the People</b></i> <br>
<sup>18</sup> “Appoint judges and officials for yourselves from each of your tribes in all the towns the Lord your God is giving you. They must judge the people fairly. <sup>19</sup> You must never twist justice or show partiality. Never accept a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the decisions of the godly. <sup>20</sup> Let true justice prevail, so you may live and occupy the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

<sup>21</sup> “You must never set up a wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build for the Lord your God. <sup>22</sup> And never set up sacred pillars for worship, for the Lord your God hates them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>“Never sacrifice sick or defective cattle, sheep, or goats to the Lord your God, for he detests such gifts.

<sup>2</sup> “When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you, a man or woman among you might do evil in the sight of the Lord your God and violate the covenant. <sup>3</sup> For instance, they might serve other gods or worship the sun, the moon, or any of the stars—the forces of heaven—which I have strictly forbidden. <sup>4</sup> When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, <sup>5</sup> then the man or woman who has committed such an evil act must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death. <sup>6</sup> But never put a person to death on the testimony of only one witness. There must always be two or three witnesses. <sup>7</sup> The witnesses must throw the first stones, and then all the people may join in. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.

<sup>8</sup> “Suppose a case arises in a local court that is too hard for you to decide—for instance, whether someone is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter, or a difficult lawsuit, or a case involving different kinds of assault. Take such legal cases to the place the Lord your God will choose, <sup>9</sup> and present them to the Levitical priests or the judge on duty at that time. They will hear the case and declare the verdict. <sup>10</sup> You must carry out the verdict they announce and the sentence they prescribe at the place the Lord chooses. You must do exactly what they say. <sup>11</sup> After they have interpreted the law and declared their verdict, the sentence they impose must be fully executed; do not modify it in any way. <sup>12</sup> Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the Lord your God must die. In this way you will purge the evil from Israel. <sup>13</sup> Then everyone else will hear about it and be afraid to act so arrogantly.
<br>
<i><b>Guidelines for a King</b></i> <br>
<sup>14</sup> “You are about to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you take it over and settle there, you may think, ‘We should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us.’ <sup>15</sup> If this happens, be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God chooses. You must appoint a fellow Israelite; he may not be a foreigner.

<sup>16</sup> “The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses, for the Lord has told you, ‘You must never return to Egypt.’ <sup>17</sup> The king must not take many wives for himself, because they will turn his heart away from the Lord. And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself.

<sup>18</sup> “When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. <sup>19</sup> He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees. <sup>20</sup> This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Gifts for the Priests and Levites</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“Remember that the Levitical priests—that is, the whole of the tribe of Levi—will receive no allotment of land among the other tribes in Israel. Instead, the priests and Levites will eat from the special gifts given to the Lord, for that is their share. <sup>2</sup> They will have no land of their own among the Israelites. The Lord himself is their special possession, just as he promised them.

<sup>3</sup> “These are the parts the priests may claim as their share from the cattle, sheep, and goats that the people bring as offerings: the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach. <sup>4</sup> You must also give to the priests the first share of the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and the wool at shearing time. <sup>5</sup> For the Lord your God chose the tribe of Levi out of all your tribes to minister in the Lord’s name forever.

<sup>6</sup> “Suppose a Levite chooses to move from his town in Israel, wherever he is living, to the place the Lord chooses for worship. <sup>7</sup> He may minister there in the name of the Lord his God, just like all his fellow Levites who are serving the Lord there. <sup>8</sup> He may eat his share of the sacrifices and offerings, even if he also receives support from his family.
<br>
<i><b>A Call to Holy Living</b></i> <br>
<sup>9</sup> “When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, be very careful not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there. <sup>10</sup> For example, never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering.[a] And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, <sup>11</sup> or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead. <sup>12</sup> Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will drive them out ahead of you. <sup>13</sup> But you must be blameless before the Lord your God. <sup>14</sup> The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers, but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things.”
<br>
<i><b>True and False Prophets</b></i> <br>
<sup>15</sup> Moses continued, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. <sup>16</sup> For this is what you yourselves requested of the Lord your God when you were assembled at Mount Sinai.[b] You said, ‘Don’t let us hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore or see this blazing fire, for we will die.’

<sup>17</sup> “Then the Lord said to me, ‘What they have said is right. <sup>18</sup> I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell the people everything I command him. <sup>19</sup> I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages the prophet proclaims on my behalf. <sup>20</sup> But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in the name of another god must die.’

<sup>21</sup> “But you may wonder, ‘How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the Lord?’ <sup>22</sup> If the prophet speaks in the Lord’s name but his prediction does not happen or come true, you will know that the Lord did not give that message. That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Cities of Refuge</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“When the Lord your God destroys the nations whose land he is giving you, you will take over their land and settle in their towns and homes. <sup>2</sup> Then you must set apart three cities of refuge in the land the Lord your God is giving you. <sup>3</sup> Survey the territory,[a] and divide the land the Lord your God is giving you into three districts, with one of these cities in each district. Then anyone who has killed someone can flee to one of the cities of refuge for safety.

<sup>4</sup> “If someone kills another person unintentionally, without previous hostility, the slayer may flee to any of these cities to live in safety. <sup>5</sup> For example, suppose someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to cut wood. And suppose one of them swings an ax to chop down a tree, and the ax head flies off the handle, killing the other person. In such cases, the slayer may flee to one of the cities of refuge to live in safety.

<sup>6</sup> “If the distance to the nearest city of refuge is too far, an enraged avenger might be able to chase down and kill the person who caused the death. Then the slayer would die unfairly, since he had never shown hostility toward the person who died. <sup>7</sup> That is why I am commanding you to set aside three cities of refuge.

<sup>8</sup> “And if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land he promised them, <sup>9</sup> you must designate three additional cities of refuge. (He will give you this land if you are careful to obey all the commands I have given you—if you always love the Lord your God and walk in his ways.) <sup>10</sup> That way you will prevent the death of innocent people in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession. You will not be held responsible for the death of innocent people.

<sup>11</sup> “But suppose someone is hostile toward a neighbor and deliberately ambushes and murders him and then flees to one of the cities of refuge. <sup>12</sup> In that case, the elders of the murderer’s hometown must send agents to the city of refuge to bring him back and hand him over to the dead person’s avenger to be put to death. <sup>13</sup> Do not feel sorry for that murderer! Purge from Israel the guilt of murdering innocent people; then all will go well with you.
<br>
<i><b>Concern for Justice</b></i> <br>
<sup>14</sup> “When you arrive in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession, you must never steal anyone’s land by moving the boundary markers your ancestors set up to mark their property.

<sup>15</sup> “You must not convict anyone of a crime on the testimony of only one witness. The facts of the case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

<sup>16</sup> “If a malicious witness comes forward and accuses someone of a crime, <sup>17</sup> then both the accuser and accused must appear before the Lord by coming to the priests and judges in office at that time. <sup>18</sup> The judges must investigate the case thoroughly. If the accuser has brought false charges against his fellow Israelite, <sup>19</sup> you must impose on the accuser the sentence he intended for the other person. In this way, you will purge such evil from among you. <sup>20</sup> Then the rest of the people will hear about it and be afraid to do such an evil thing. <sup>21</sup> You must show no pity for the guilty! Your rule should be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Regulations concerning War</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“When you go out to fight your enemies and you face horses and chariots and an army greater than your own, do not be afraid. The Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you! <sup>2</sup> When you prepare for battle, the priest must come forward to speak to the troops. <sup>3</sup> He will say to them, ‘Listen to me, all you men of Israel! Do not be afraid as you go out to fight your enemies today! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble before them. <sup>4</sup> For the Lord your God is going with you! He will fight for you against your enemies, and he will give you victory!’

<sup>5</sup> “Then the officers of the army must address the troops and say, ‘Has anyone here just built a new house but not yet dedicated it? If so, you may go home! You might be killed in the battle, and someone else would dedicate your house. <sup>6</sup> Has anyone here just planted a vineyard but not yet eaten any of its fruit? If so, you may go home! You might die in battle, and someone else would eat the first fruit. <sup>7</sup> Has anyone here just become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? Well, you may go home and get married! You might die in the battle, and someone else would marry her.’

<sup>8</sup> “Then the officers will also say, ‘Is anyone here afraid or worried? If you are, you may go home before you frighten anyone else.’ <sup>9</sup> When the officers have finished speaking to their troops, they will appoint the unit commanders.

<sup>10</sup> “As you approach a town to attack it, you must first offer its people terms for peace. <sup>11</sup> If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor. <sup>12</sup> But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town. <sup>13</sup> When the Lord your God hands the town over to you, use your swords to kill every man in the town. <sup>14</sup> But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder. You may enjoy the plunder from your enemies that the Lord your God has given you.

<sup>15</sup> “But these instructions apply only to distant towns, not to the towns of the nations in the land you will enter. <sup>16</sup> In those towns that the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession, destroy every living thing. <sup>17</sup> You must completely destroy[a] the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you. <sup>18</sup> This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you to sin deeply against the Lord your God.

<sup>19</sup> “When you are attacking a town and the war drags on, you must not cut down the trees with your axes. You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the trees. Are the trees your enemies, that you should attack them? <sup>20</sup> You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food. Use them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Cleansing for Unsolved Murder</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“When you are in the land the Lord your God is giving you, someone may be found murdered in a field, and you don’t know who committed the murder. <sup>2</sup> In such a case, your elders and judges must measure the distance from the site of the crime to the nearby towns. <sup>3</sup> When the nearest town has been determined, that town’s elders must select from the herd a heifer that has never been trained or yoked to a plow. <sup>4</sup> They must lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and that has a stream running through it. There in the valley they must break the heifer’s neck. <sup>5</sup> Then the Levitical priests must step forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in the Lord’s name. They are to decide all legal and criminal cases.

<sup>6</sup> “The elders of the town must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken. <sup>7</sup> Then they must say, ‘Our hands did not shed this person’s blood, nor did we see it happen. <sup>8</sup> O Lord, forgive your people Israel whom you have redeemed. Do not charge your people with the guilt of murdering an innocent person.’ Then they will be absolved of the guilt of this person’s blood. <sup>9</sup> By following these instructions, you will do what is right in the Lord’s sight and will cleanse the guilt of murder from your community.
<br>
<i><b>Marriage to a Captive Woman</b></i> <br>
<sup>10</sup> “Suppose you go out to war against your enemies and the Lord your God hands them over to you, and you take some of them as captives. <sup>11</sup> And suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her and want to marry her. <sup>12</sup> If this happens, you may take her to your home, where she must shave her head, cut her nails, <sup>13</sup> and change the clothes she was wearing when she was captured. She will stay in your home, but let her mourn for her father and mother for a full month. Then you may marry her, and you will be her husband and she will be your wife. <sup>14</sup> But if you marry her and she does not please you, you must let her go free. You may not sell her or treat her as a slave, for you have humiliated her.
<br>
<i><b>Rights of the Firstborn</b></i> <br>
<sup>15</sup> “Suppose a man has two wives, but he loves one and not the other, and both have given him sons. And suppose the firstborn son is the son of the wife he does not love. <sup>16</sup> When the man divides his inheritance, he may not give the larger inheritance to his younger son, the son of the wife he loves, as if he were the firstborn son. <sup>17</sup> He must recognize the rights of his oldest son, the son of the wife he does not love, by giving him a double portion. He is the first son of his father’s virility, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him.
<br>
<i><b>Dealing with a Rebellious Son</b></i> <br>
<sup>18</sup> “Suppose a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father or mother, even though they discipline him. <sup>19</sup> In such a case, the father and mother must take the son to the elders as they hold court at the town gate. <sup>20</sup> The parents must say to the elders, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and refuses to obey. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ <sup>21</sup> Then all the men of his town must stone him to death. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you, and all Israel will hear about it and be afraid.

<sup>22</sup> “If someone has committed a crime worthy of death and is executed and hung on a tree,[a] <sup>23</sup> the body must not remain hanging from the tree overnight. You must bury the body that same day, for anyone who is hung[b] is cursed in the sight of God. In this way, you will prevent the defilement of the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>“If you see your neighbor’s ox or sheep or goat wandering away, don’t ignore your responsibility.[a] Take it back to its owner. <sup>2</sup> If its owner does not live nearby or you don’t know who the owner is, take it to your place and keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then you must return it. <sup>3</sup> Do the same if you find your neighbor’s donkey, clothing, or anything else your neighbor loses. Don’t ignore your responsibility.

<sup>4</sup> “If you see that your neighbor’s donkey or ox has collapsed on the road, do not look the other way. Go and help your neighbor get it back on its feet!

<sup>5</sup> “A woman must not put on men’s clothing, and a man must not wear women’s clothing. Anyone who does this is detestable in the sight of the Lord your God.

<sup>6</sup> “If you happen to find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground, and there are young ones or eggs in it with the mother sitting in the nest, do not take the mother with the young. <sup>7</sup> You may take the young, but let the mother go, so that you may prosper and enjoy a long life.

<sup>8</sup> “When you build a new house, you must build a railing around the edge of its flat roof. That way you will not be considered guilty of murder if someone falls from the roof.

<sup>9</sup> “You must not plant any other crop between the rows of your vineyard. If you do, you are forbidden to use either the grapes from the vineyard or the other crop.

<sup>10</sup> “You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.

<i><b>Regulations for Sexual Purity</b></i> <br>
<sup>13</sup> “Suppose a man marries a woman, but after sleeping with her, he turns against her <sup>14</sup> and publicly accuses her of shameful conduct, saying, ‘When I married this woman, I discovered she was not a virgin.’ <sup>15</sup> Then the woman’s father and mother must bring the proof of her virginity to the elders as they hold court at the town gate. <sup>16</sup> Her father must say to them, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, and now he has turned against her. <sup>17</sup> He has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, “I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin.” But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.’ Then they must spread her bed sheet before the elders. <sup>18</sup> The elders must then take the man and punish him. <sup>19</sup> They must also fine him 100 pieces of silver,[b] which he must pay to the woman’s father because he publicly accused a virgin of Israel of shameful conduct. The woman will then remain the man’s wife, and he may never divorce her.

<sup>20</sup> “But suppose the man’s accusations are true, and he can show that she was not a virgin. <sup>21</sup> The woman must be taken to the door of her father’s home, and there the men of the town must stone her to death, for she has committed a disgraceful crime in Israel by being promiscuous while living in her parents’ home. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you.

<sup>22</sup> “If a man is discovered committing adultery, both he and the woman must die. In this way, you will purge Israel of such evil.

<sup>23</sup> “Suppose a man meets a young woman, a virgin who is engaged to be married, and he has sexual intercourse with her. If this happens within a town, <sup>24</sup> you must take both of them to the gates of that town and stone them to death. The woman is guilty because she did not scream for help. The man must die because he violated another man’s wife. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you.

<sup>25</sup> “But if the man meets the engaged woman out in the country, and he rapes her, then only the man must die. <sup>26</sup> Do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no crime worthy of death. She is as innocent as a murder victim. <sup>27</sup> Since the man raped her out in the country, it must be assumed that she screamed, but there was no one to rescue her.

<sup>28</sup> “Suppose a man has intercourse with a young woman who is a virgin but is not engaged to be married. If they are discovered, <sup>29</sup> he must pay her father fifty pieces of silver.[c] Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he may never divorce her as long as he lives.

<sup>30</sup> [d]“A man must not marry his father’s former wife, for this would violate his father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Regulations concerning Worship</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“If a man’s testicles are crushed or his penis is cut off, he may not be admitted to the assembly of the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> “If a person is illegitimate by birth, neither he nor his descendants for ten generations may be admitted to the assembly of the Lord.

<sup>3</sup> “No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants for ten generations may be admitted to the assembly of the Lord. <sup>4</sup> These nations did not welcome you with food and water when you came out of Egypt. Instead, they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in distant Aram-naharaim to curse you. <sup>5</sup> But the Lord your God refused to listen to Balaam. He turned the intended curse into a blessing because the Lord your God loves you. <sup>6</sup> As long as you live, you must never promote the welfare and prosperity of the Ammonites or Moabites.

<sup>7</sup> “Do not detest the Edomites or the Egyptians, because the Edomites are your relatives and you lived as foreigners among the Egyptians. <sup>8</sup> The third generation of Edomites and Egyptians may enter the assembly of the Lord.
<br>
<i><b>Miscellaneous Regulations</b></i> <br>
<sup>9</sup> “When you go to war against your enemies, be sure to stay away from anything that is impure.

<sup>10</sup> “Any man who becomes ceremonially defiled because of a nocturnal emission must leave the camp and stay away all day. <sup>11</sup> Toward evening he must bathe himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp.

<sup>12</sup> “You must have a designated area outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. <sup>13</sup> Each of you must have a spade as part of your equipment. Whenever you relieve yourself, dig a hole with the spade and cover the excrement. <sup>14</sup> The camp must be holy, for the Lord your God moves around in your camp to protect you and to defeat your enemies. He must not see any shameful thing among you, or he will turn away from you.

<sup>15</sup> “If slaves should escape from their masters and take refuge with you, you must not hand them over to their masters. <sup>16</sup> Let them live among you in any town they choose, and do not oppress them.

<sup>17</sup> “No Israelite, whether man or woman, may become a temple prostitute. <sup>18</sup> When you are bringing an offering to fulfill a vow, you must not bring to the house of the Lord your God any offering from the earnings of a prostitute, whether a man[b] or a woman, for both are detestable to the Lord your God.

<sup>19</sup> “Do not charge interest on the loans you make to a fellow Israelite, whether you loan money, or food, or anything else. <sup>20</sup> You may charge interest to foreigners, but you may not charge interest to Israelites, so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you do in the land you are about to enter and occupy.

<sup>21</sup> “When you make a vow to the Lord your God, be prompt in fulfilling whatever you promised him. For the Lord your God demands that you promptly fulfill all your vows, or you will be guilty of sin. <sup>22</sup> However, it is not a sin to refrain from making a vow. <sup>23</sup> But once you have voluntarily made a vow, be careful to fulfill your promise to the Lord your God.

<sup>24</sup> “When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, but you must not carry any away in a basket. <sup>25</sup> And when you enter your neighbor’s field of grain, you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand, but you must not harvest it with a sickle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>“Suppose a man marries a woman but she does not please him. Having discovered something wrong with her, he writes a document of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house. <sup>2</sup> When she leaves his house, she is free to marry another man. <sup>3</sup> But if the second husband also turns against her, writes a document of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away, or if he dies, <sup>4</sup> the first husband may not marry her again, for she has been defiled. That would be detestable to the Lord. You must not bring guilt upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession.

<sup>5</sup> “A newly married man must not be drafted into the army or be given any other official responsibilities. He must be free to spend one year at home, bringing happiness to the wife he has married.

<sup>6</sup> “It is wrong to take a set of millstones, or even just the upper millstone, as security for a loan, for the owner uses it to make a living.

<sup>7</sup> “If anyone kidnaps a fellow Israelite and treats him as a slave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.

<sup>8</sup> “In all cases involving serious skin diseases,[a] be careful to follow the instructions of the Levitical priests; obey all the commands I have given them. <sup>9</sup> Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam as you were coming from Egypt.

<sup>10</sup> “If you lend anything to your neighbor, do not enter his house to pick up the item he is giving as security. <sup>11</sup> You must wait outside while he goes in and brings it out to you. <sup>12</sup> If your neighbor is poor and gives you his cloak as security for a loan, do not keep the cloak overnight. <sup>13</sup> Return the cloak to its owner by sunset so he can stay warm through the night and bless you, and the Lord your God will count you as righteous.

<sup>14</sup> “Never take advantage of poor and destitute laborers, whether they are fellow Israelites or foreigners living in your towns. <sup>15</sup> You must pay them their wages each day before sunset because they are poor and are counting on it. If you don’t, they might cry out to the Lord against you, and it would be counted against you as sin.

<sup>16</sup> “Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of their parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes.

<sup>17</sup> “True justice must be given to foreigners living among you and to orphans, and you must never accept a widow’s garment as security for her debt. <sup>18</sup> Always remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from your slavery. That is why I have given you this command.

<sup>19</sup> “When you are harvesting your crops and forget to bring in a bundle of grain from your field, don’t go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all you do. <sup>20</sup> When you beat the olives from your olive trees, don’t go over the boughs twice. Leave the remaining olives for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. <sup>21</sup> When you gather the grapes in your vineyard, don’t glean the vines after they are picked. Leave the remaining grapes for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. <sup>22</sup> Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. That is why I am giving you this command.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>“Suppose two people take a dispute to court, and the judges declare that one is right and the other is wrong. <sup>2</sup> If the person in the wrong is sentenced to be flogged, the judge must command him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes appropriate to the crime. <sup>3</sup> But never give more than forty lashes; more than forty lashes would publicly humiliate your neighbor.

<sup>4</sup> “You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.

<sup>5</sup> “If two brothers are living together on the same property and one of them dies without a son, his widow may not be married to anyone from outside the family. Instead, her husband’s brother should marry her and have intercourse with her to fulfill the duties of a brother-in-law. <sup>6</sup> The first son she bears to him will be considered the son of the dead brother, so that his name will not be forgotten in Israel.

<sup>7</sup> “But if the man refuses to marry his brother’s widow, she must go to the town gate and say to the elders assembled there, ‘My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel—he refuses to fulfill the duties of a brother-in-law by marrying me.’ <sup>8</sup> The elders of the town will then summon him and talk with him. If he still refuses and says, ‘I don’t want to marry her,’ <sup>9</sup> the widow must walk over to him in the presence of the elders, pull his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face. Then she must declare, ‘This is what happens to a man who refuses to provide his brother with children.’ <sup>10</sup> Ever afterward in Israel his family will be referred to as ‘the family of the man whose sandal was pulled off’!

<sup>11</sup> “If two Israelite men get into a fight and the wife of one tries to rescue her husband by grabbing the testicles of the other man, <sup>12</sup> you must cut off her hand. Show her no pity.

<sup>13</sup> “You must use accurate scales when you weigh out merchandise, <sup>14</sup> and you must use full and honest measures. <sup>15</sup> Yes, always use honest weights and measures, so that you may enjoy a long life in the land the Lord your God is giving you. <sup>16</sup> All who cheat with dishonest weights and measures are detestable to the Lord your God.

<sup>17</sup> “Never forget what the Amalekites did to you as you came from Egypt. <sup>18</sup> They attacked you when you were exhausted and weary, and they struck down those who were straggling behind. They had no fear of God. <sup>19</sup> Therefore, when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies in the land he is giving you as a special possession, you must destroy the Amalekites and erase their memory from under heaven. Never forget this!</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Harvest Offerings and Tithes</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession and you have conquered it and settled there, <sup>2</sup> put some of the first produce from each crop you harvest into a basket and bring it to the designated place of worship—the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored. <sup>3</sup> Go to the priest in charge at that time and say to him, ‘With this gift I acknowledge to the Lord your God that I have entered the land he swore to our ancestors he would give us.’ <sup>4</sup> The priest will then take the basket from your hand and set it before the altar of the Lord your God.

<sup>5</sup> “You must then say in the presence of the Lord your God, ‘My ancestor Jacob was a wandering Aramean who went to live as a foreigner in Egypt. His family arrived few in number, but in Egypt they became a large and mighty nation. <sup>6</sup> When the Egyptians oppressed and humiliated us by making us their slaves, <sup>7</sup> we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors. He heard our cries and saw our hardship, toil, and oppression. <sup>8</sup> So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and powerful arm, with overwhelming terror, and with miraculous signs and wonders. <sup>9</sup> He brought us to this place and gave us this land flowing with milk and honey! <sup>10</sup> And now, O Lord, I have brought you the first portion of the harvest you have given me from the ground.’ Then place the produce before the Lord your God, and bow to the ground in worship before him. <sup>11</sup> Afterward you may go and celebrate because of all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your household. Remember to include the Levites and the foreigners living among you in the celebration.

<sup>12</sup> “Every third year you must offer a special tithe of your crops. In this year of the special tithe you must give your tithes to the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows, so that they will have enough to eat in your towns. <sup>13</sup> Then you must declare in the presence of the Lord your God, ‘I have taken the sacred gift from my house and have given it to the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows, just as you commanded me. I have not violated or forgotten any of your commands. <sup>14</sup> I have not eaten any of it while in mourning; I have not handled it while I was ceremonially unclean; and I have not offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my God and have done everything you commanded me. <sup>15</sup> Now look down from your holy dwelling place in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you swore to our ancestors to give us—a land flowing with milk and honey.’
<br>
<i><b>A Call to Obey the Lord’s Commands</b></i> <br>
<sup>16</sup> “Today the Lord your God has commanded you to obey all these decrees and regulations. So be careful to obey them wholeheartedly. <sup>17</sup> You have declared today that the Lord is your God. And you have promised to walk in his ways, and to obey his decrees, commands, and regulations, and to do everything he tells you. <sup>18</sup> The Lord has declared today that you are his people, his own special treasure, just as he promised, and that you must obey all his commands. <sup>19</sup> And if you do, he will set you high above all the other nations he has made.

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>The Altar on Mount Ebal</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>Then Moses and the leaders of Israel gave this charge to the people: “Obey all these commands that I am giving you today. <sup>2</sup> When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster. <sup>3</sup> Write this whole body of instruction on them when you cross the river to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you—a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you. <sup>4</sup> When you cross the Jordan, set up these stones at Mount Ebal and coat them with plaster, as I am commanding you today.

<sup>5</sup> “Then build an altar there to the Lord your God, using natural, uncut stones. You must not shape the stones with an iron tool. <sup>6</sup> Build the altar of uncut stones, and use it to offer burnt offerings to the Lord your God. <sup>7</sup> Also sacrifice peace offerings on it, and celebrate by feasting there before the Lord your God. <sup>8</sup> You must clearly write all these instructions on the stones coated with plaster.”

<sup>9</sup> Then Moses and the Levitical priests addressed all Israel as follows: “O Israel, be quiet and listen! Today you have become the people of the Lord your God. <sup>10</sup> So you must obey the Lord your God by keeping all these commands and decrees that I am giving you today.”
<br>
<i><b>Curses from Mount Ebal</b></i> <br>
<sup>11</sup> That same day Moses also gave this charge to the people: <sup>12</sup> “When you cross the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on Mount Gerizim to proclaim a blessing over the people. <sup>13</sup> And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on Mount Ebal to proclaim a curse.

<sup>14</sup> “Then the Levites will shout to all the people of Israel:

And all the people will reply, ‘Amen.’

<sup>16</sup> ‘Cursed is anyone who dishonors father or mother.’

And all the people will reply, ‘Amen.’

<sup>17</sup> ‘Cursed is anyone who steals property from a neighbor by moving a boundary marker.’

<sup>25</sup> “The Lord will cause you to be defeated by your enemies. You will attack your enemies from one direction, but you will scatter from them in seven! You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. <sup>26</sup> Your corpses will be food for all the scavenging birds and wild animals, and no one will be there to chase them away.

<sup>27</sup> “The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, scurvy, and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. <sup>28</sup> The Lord will strike you with madness, blindness, and panic. <sup>29</sup> You will grope around in broad daylight like a blind person groping in the darkness, but you will not find your way. You will be oppressed and robbed continually, and no one will come to save you.

<sup>30</sup> “You will be engaged to a woman, but another man will sleep with her. You will build a house, but someone else will live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will never enjoy its fruit. <sup>31</sup> Your ox will be butchered before your eyes, but you will not eat a single bite of the meat. Your donkey will be taken from you, never to be returned. Your sheep and goats will be given to your enemies, and no one will be there to help you. <sup>32</sup> You will watch as your sons and daughters are taken away as slaves. Your heart will break for them, but you won’t be able to help them. <sup>33</sup> A foreign nation you have never heard about will eat the crops you worked so hard to grow. You will suffer under constant oppression and harsh treatment. <sup>34</sup> You will go mad because of all the tragedy you see around you. <sup>35</sup> The Lord will cover your knees and legs with incurable boils. In fact, you will be covered from head to foot.

<sup>36</sup> “The Lord will exile you and your king to a nation unknown to you and your ancestors. There in exile you will worship gods of wood and stone! <sup>37</sup> You will become an object of horror, ridicule, and mockery among all the nations to which the Lord sends you.

<sup>38</sup> “You will plant much but harvest little, for locusts will eat your crops. <sup>39</sup> You will plant vineyards and care for them, but you will not drink the wine or eat the grapes, for worms will destroy the vines. <sup>40</sup> You will grow olive trees throughout your land, but you will never use the olive oil, for the fruit will drop before it ripens. <sup>41</sup> You will have sons and daughters, but you will lose them, for they will be led away into captivity. <sup>42</sup> Swarms of insects will destroy your trees and crops.

You will be left hungry, thirsty, naked, and lacking in everything. The Lord will put an iron yoke on your neck, oppressing you harshly until he has destroyed you.

<sup>49</sup> “The Lord will bring a distant nation against you from the end of the earth, and it will swoop down on you like a vulture. It is a nation whose language you do not understand, <sup>50</sup> a fierce and heartless nation that shows no respect for the old and no pity for the young. <sup>51</sup> Its armies will devour your livestock and crops, and you will be destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine, olive oil, calves, or lambs, and you will starve to death. <sup>52</sup> They will attack your cities until all the fortified walls in your land—the walls you trusted to protect you—are knocked down. They will attack all the towns in the land the Lord your God has given you.

<sup>53</sup> “The siege and terrible distress of the enemy’s attack will be so severe that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters, whom the Lord your God has given you. <sup>54</sup> The most tenderhearted man among you will have no compassion for his own brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving children. <sup>55</sup> He will refuse to share with them the flesh he is devouring—the flesh of one of his own children—because he has nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns. <sup>56</sup> The most tender and delicate woman among you—so delicate she would not so much as touch the ground with her foot—will be selfish toward the husband she loves and toward her own son or daughter. <sup>57</sup> She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne, so that she herself can secretly eat them. She will have nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.

<sup>58</sup> “If you refuse to obey all the words of instruction that are written in this book, and if you do not fear the glorious and awesome name of the Lord your God, <sup>59</sup> then the Lord will overwhelm you and your children with indescribable plagues. These plagues will be intense and without relief, making you miserable and unbearably sick. <sup>60</sup> He will afflict you with all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so much, and you will have no relief. <sup>61</sup> The Lord will afflict you with every sickness and plague there is, even those not mentioned in this Book of Instruction, until you are destroyed. <sup>62</sup> Though you become as numerous as the stars in the sky, few of you will be left because you would not listen to the Lord your God.

<sup>63</sup> “Just as the Lord has found great pleasure in causing you to prosper and multiply, the Lord will find pleasure in destroying you. You will be torn from the land you are about to enter and occupy. <sup>64</sup> For the Lord will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship foreign gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods made of wood and stone! <sup>65</sup> There among those nations you will find no peace or place to rest. And the Lord will cause your heart to tremble, your eyesight to fail, and your soul to despair. <sup>66</sup> Your life will constantly hang in the balance. You will live night and day in fear, unsure if you will survive. <sup>67</sup> In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were night!’ And in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’ For you will be terrified by the awful horrors you see around you. <sup>68</sup> Then the Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships, to a destination I promised you would never see again. There you will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves, but no one will buy you.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites while they were in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Mount Sinai.[b]
<br>
<i><b>Moses Reviews the Covenant</b></i> <br>
<sup>2</sup> [c]Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the Lord did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to his whole country— <sup>3</sup> all the great tests of strength, the miraculous signs, and the amazing wonders. <sup>4</sup> But to this day the Lord has not given you minds that understand, nor eyes that see, nor ears that hear! <sup>5</sup> For forty years I led you through the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out. <sup>6</sup> You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink, but he provided for you so you would know that he is the Lord your God.

<sup>7</sup> “When we came here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. <sup>8</sup> We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land.

<sup>9</sup> “Therefore, obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in everything you do. <sup>10</sup> All of you—tribal leaders, elders, officers, all the men of Israel—are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God. <sup>11</sup> Your little ones and your wives are with you, as well as the foreigners living among you who chop your wood and carry your water. <sup>12</sup> You are standing here today to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God. The Lord is making this covenant, including the curses. <sup>13</sup> By entering into the covenant today, he will establish you as his people and confirm that he is your God, just as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

<sup>14</sup> “But you are not the only ones with whom I am making this covenant with its curses. <sup>15</sup> I am making this covenant both with you who stand here today in the presence of the Lord our God, and also with the future generations who are not standing here today.

<sup>16</sup> “You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the lands of enemy nations as we left. <sup>17</sup> You have seen their detestable practices and their idols[d] made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. <sup>18</sup> I am making this covenant with you so that no one among you—no man, woman, clan, or tribe—will turn away from the Lord our God to worship these gods of other nations, and so that no root among you bears bitter and poisonous fruit.

<sup>19</sup> “Those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves, thinking, ‘I am safe, even though I am following the desires of my own stubborn heart.’ This would lead to utter ruin! <sup>20</sup> The Lord will never pardon such people. Instead his anger and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will come down on them, and the Lord will erase their names from under heaven. <sup>21</sup> The Lord will separate them from all the tribes of Israel, to pour out on them all the curses of the covenant recorded in this Book of Instruction.

<sup>22</sup> “Then the generations to come, both your own descendants and the foreigners who come from distant lands, will see the devastation of the land and the diseases the Lord inflicts on it. <sup>23</sup> They will exclaim, ‘The whole land is devastated by sulfur and salt. It is a wasteland with nothing planted and nothing growing, not even a blade of grass. It is like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord destroyed in his intense anger.’

<sup>24</sup> “And all the surrounding nations will ask, ‘Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why was he so angry?’

<sup>25</sup> “And the answer will be, ‘This happened because the people of the land abandoned the covenant that the Lord, the God of their ancestors, made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. <sup>26</sup> Instead, they turned away to serve and worship gods they had not known before, gods that were not from the Lord. <sup>27</sup> That is why the Lord’s anger has burned against this land, bringing down on it every curse recorded in this book. <sup>28</sup> In great anger and fury the Lord uprooted his people from their land and banished them to another land, where they still live today!’

<sup>29</sup> “The Lord our God has secrets known to no one. We are not accountable for them, but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed to us, so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>A Call to Return to the Lord</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>“In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the Lord your God has exiled you, take to heart all these instructions. <sup>2</sup> If at that time you and your children return to the Lord your God, and if you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given you today, <sup>3</sup> then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes. He will have mercy on you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you. <sup>4</sup> Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth,[a] the Lord your God will gather you from there and bring you back again. <sup>5</sup> The Lord your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will possess that land again. Then he will make you even more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors!

<sup>6</sup> “The Lord your God will change your heart[b] and the hearts of all your descendants, so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live! <sup>7</sup> The Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you. <sup>8</sup> Then you will again obey the Lord and keep all his commands that I am giving you today.

<sup>9</sup> “The Lord your God will then make you successful in everything you do. He will give you many children and numerous livestock, and he will cause your fields to produce abundant harvests, for the Lord will again delight in being good to you as he was to your ancestors. <sup>10</sup> The Lord your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction, and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul.
<br>
<i><b>The Choice of Life or Death</b></i> <br>
<sup>11</sup> “This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, and it is not beyond your reach. <sup>12</sup> It is not kept in heaven, so distant that you must ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey?’ <sup>13</sup> It is not kept beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey?’ <sup>14</sup> No, the message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it.

<sup>15</sup> “Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death, between prosperity and disaster. <sup>16</sup> For I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to keep his commands, decrees, and regulations by walking in his ways. If you do this, you will live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you and the land you are about to enter and occupy.

<sup>17</sup> “But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen, and if you are drawn away to serve and worship other gods, <sup>18</sup> then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live a long, good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.

<sup>19</sup> “Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live! <sup>20</sup> You can make this choice by loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and committing yourself firmly to him. This[c] is the key to your life. And if you love and obey the Lord, you will live long in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Joshua Becomes Israel's Leader</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>When Moses had finished giving these instructions[a] to all the people of Israel, <sup>2</sup> he said, “I am now 120 years old, and I am no longer able to lead you. The Lord has told me, ‘You will not cross the Jordan River.’ <sup>3</sup> But the Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy the nations living there, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua will lead you across the river, just as the Lord promised.

<sup>4</sup> “The Lord will destroy the nations living in the land, just as he destroyed Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites. <sup>5</sup> The Lord will hand over to you the people who live there, and you must deal with them as I have commanded you. <sup>6</sup> So be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid and do not panic before them. For the Lord your God will personally go ahead of you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.”

<sup>7</sup> Then Moses called for Joshua, and as all Israel watched, he said to him, “Be strong and courageous! For you will lead these people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors he would give them. You are the one who will divide it among them as their grants of land. <sup>8</sup> Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you; he will neither fail you nor abandon you.”
<br>
<i><b>Public Reading of the Book of Law</b></i> <br>
<sup>9</sup> So Moses wrote this entire body of instruction in a book and gave it to the priests, who carried the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and to the elders of Israel. <sup>10</sup> Then Moses gave them this command: “At the end of every seventh year, the Year of Release, during the Festival of Shelters, <sup>11</sup> you must read this Book of Instruction to all the people of Israel when they assemble before the Lord your God at the place he chooses. <sup>12</sup> Call them all together—men, women, children, and the foreigners living in your towns—so they may hear this Book of Instruction and learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully obey all the terms of these instructions. <sup>13</sup> Do this so that your children who have not known these instructions will hear them and will learn to fear the Lord your God. Do this as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.”
<br>
<i><b>Israel’s Disobedience Predicted</b></i> <br>
<sup>14</sup> Then the Lord said to Moses, “The time has come for you to die. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tabernacle,[b] so that I may commission him there.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tabernacle. <sup>15</sup> And the Lord appeared to them in a pillar of cloud that stood at the entrance to the sacred tent.

<sup>16</sup> The Lord said to Moses, “You are about to die and join your ancestors. After you are gone, these people will begin to worship foreign gods, the gods of the land where they are going. They will abandon me and break my covenant that I have made with them. <sup>17</sup> Then my anger will blaze forth against them. I will abandon them, hiding my face from them, and they will be devoured. Terrible trouble will come down on them, and on that day they will say, ‘These disasters have come down on us because God is no longer among us!’ <sup>18</sup> At that time I will hide my face from them on account of all the evil they commit by worshiping other gods.

<sup>19</sup> “So write down the words of this song, and teach it to the people of Israel. Help them learn it, so it may serve as a witness for me against them. <sup>20</sup> For I will bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors—a land flowing with milk and honey. There they will become prosperous, eat all the food they want, and become fat. But they will begin to worship other gods; they will despise me and break my covenant. <sup>21</sup> And when great disasters come down on them, this song will stand as evidence against them, for it will never be forgotten by their descendants. I know the intentions of these people, even now before they have entered the land I swore to give them.”

<sup>22</sup> So that very day Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it to the Israelites.

<sup>23</sup> Then the Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun with these words: “Be strong and courageous, for you must bring the people of Israel into the land I swore to give them. I will be with you.”

<sup>24</sup> When Moses had finished writing this entire body of instruction in a book, <sup>25</sup> he gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant: <sup>26</sup> “Take this Book of Instruction and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, so it may remain there as a witness against the people of Israel. <sup>27</sup> For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Even now, while I am still alive and am here with you, you have rebelled against the Lord. How much more rebellious will you be after my death!

<sup>28</sup> “Now summon all the elders and officials of your tribes, so that I can speak to them directly and call heaven and earth to witness against them. <sup>29</sup> I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and will turn from the way I have commanded you to follow. In the days to come, disaster will come down on you, for you will do what is evil in the Lord’s sight, making him very angry with your actions.”
<br>
<i><b>The Song of Moses</b></i> <br>
<sup>30</sup> So Moses recited this entire song publicly to the assembly of Israel:</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>“Listen, O heavens, and I will speak!
    Hear, O earth, the words that I say!
<sup>2</sup> Let my teaching fall on you like rain;
    let my speech settle like dew.
Let my words fall like rain on tender grass,
    like gentle showers on young plants.
<sup>3</sup> I will proclaim the name of the Lord;
    how glorious is our God!
<sup>4</sup> He is the Rock; his deeds are perfect.
    Everything he does is just and fair.
He is a faithful God who does no wrong;
    how just and upright he is!

<sup>5</sup> “But they have acted corruptly toward him;
    when they act so perversely,
are they really his children?[a]
    They are a deceitful and twisted generation.
<sup>6</sup> Is this the way you repay the Lord,
    you foolish and senseless people?
Isn’t he your Father who created you?
    Has he not made you and established you?
<sup>7</sup> Remember the days of long ago;
    think about the generations past.
Ask your father, and he will inform you.
    Inquire of your elders, and they will tell you.
<sup>8</sup> When the Most High assigned lands to the nations,
    when he divided up the human race,
he established the boundaries of the peoples
    according to the number in his heavenly court.[b]

<sup>9</sup> “For the people of Israel belong to the Lord;
    Jacob is his special possession.
<sup>10</sup> He found them in a desert land,
    in an empty, howling wasteland.
He surrounded them and watched over them;
    he guarded them as he would guard his own eyes.[c]
<sup>11</sup> Like an eagle that rouses her chicks
    and hovers over her young,
so he spread his wings to take them up
    and carried them safely on his pinions.
<sup>12</sup> The Lord alone guided them;
    they followed no foreign gods.
<sup>13</sup> He let them ride over the highlands
    and feast on the crops of the fields.
He nourished them with honey from the rock
    and olive oil from the stony ground.
<sup>14</sup> He fed them yogurt from the herd
    and milk from the flock,
    together with the fat of lambs.
He gave them choice rams from Bashan, and goats,
    together with the choicest wheat.
You drank the finest wine,
    made from the juice of grapes.

<sup>15</sup> “But Israel[d] soon became fat and unruly;
    the people grew heavy, plump, and stuffed!
Then they abandoned the God who had made them;
    they made light of the Rock of their salvation.
<sup>16</sup> They stirred up his jealousy by worshiping foreign gods;
    they provoked his fury with detestable deeds.
<sup>17</sup> They offered sacrifices to demons, which are not God,
    to gods they had not known before,
to new gods only recently arrived,
    to gods their ancestors had never feared.
<sup>18</sup> You neglected the Rock who had fathered you;
    you forgot the God who had given you birth.

<sup>19</sup> “The Lord saw this and drew back,
    provoked to anger by his own sons and daughters.
<sup>20</sup> He said, ‘I will abandon them;
    then see what becomes of them.
For they are a twisted generation,
    children without integrity.
<sup>21</sup> They have roused my jealousy by worshiping things that are not God;
    they have provoked my anger with their useless idols.
Now I will rouse their jealousy through people who are not even a people;
    I will provoke their anger through the foolish Gentiles.
<sup>22</sup> For my anger blazes forth like fire
    and burns to the depths of the grave.[e]
It devours the earth and all its crops
    and ignites the foundations of the mountains.
<sup>23</sup> I will heap disasters upon them
    and shoot them down with my arrows.
<sup>24</sup> I will weaken them with famine,
    burning fever, and deadly disease.
I will send the fangs of wild beasts
    and poisonous snakes that glide in the dust.
<sup>25</sup> Outside, the sword will bring death,
    and inside, terror will strike
both young men and young women,
    both infants and the aged.
<sup>26</sup> I would have annihilated them,
    wiping out even the memory of them.
<sup>27</sup> But I feared the taunt of Israel’s enemy,
    who might misunderstand and say,
“Our own power has triumphed!
    The Lord had nothing to do with this!”’

<sup>28</sup> “But Israel is a senseless nation;
    the people are foolish, without understanding.
<sup>29</sup> Oh, that they were wise and could understand this!
    Oh, that they might know their fate!
<sup>30</sup> How could one person chase a thousand of them,
    and two people put ten thousand to flight,
unless their Rock had sold them,
    unless the Lord had given them up?
<sup>31</sup> But the rock of our enemies is not like our Rock,
    as even they recognize.[f]
<sup>32</sup> Their vine grows from the vine of Sodom,
    from the vineyards of Gomorrah.
Their grapes are poison,
    and their clusters are bitter.
<sup>33</sup> Their wine is the venom of serpents,
    the deadly poison of cobras.

<sup>34</sup> “The Lord says, ‘Am I not storing up these things,
    sealing them away in my treasury?
<sup>35</sup> I will take revenge; I will pay them back.
    In due time their feet will slip.
Their day of disaster will arrive,
    and their destiny will overtake them.’

<sup>36</sup> “Indeed, the Lord will give justice to his people,
    and he will change his mind about[g] his servants,
when he sees their strength is gone
    and no one is left, slave or free.
<sup>37</sup> Then he will ask, ‘Where are their gods,
    the rocks they fled to for refuge?
<sup>38</sup> Where now are those gods,
    who ate the fat of their sacrifices
    and drank the wine of their offerings?
Let those gods arise and help you!
    Let them provide you with shelter!
<sup>39</sup> Look now; I myself am he!
    There is no other god but me!
I am the one who kills and gives life;
    I am the one who wounds and heals;
    no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!
<sup>40</sup> Now I raise my hand to heaven
    and declare, “As surely as I live,
<sup>41</sup> when I sharpen my flashing sword
    and begin to carry out justice,
I will take revenge on my enemies
    and repay those who reject me.
<sup>42</sup> I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
    and my sword will devour flesh—
the blood of the slaughtered and the captives,
    and the heads of the enemy leaders.”’

<sup>43</sup> “Rejoice with him, you heavens,
    and let all of God’s angels worship him.[h]
Rejoice with his people, you Gentiles,
    and let all the angels be strengthened in him.[i]
For he will avenge the blood of his children[j];
    he will take revenge against his enemies.
He will repay those who hate him[k]
    and cleanse his people’s land.”

<sup>44</sup> So Moses came with Joshua[l] son of Nun and recited all the words of this song to the people.

<sup>45</sup> When Moses had finished reciting all these words to the people of Israel, <sup>46</sup> he added: “Take to heart all the words of warning I have given you today. Pass them on as a command to your children so they will obey every word of these instructions. <sup>47</sup> These instructions are not empty words—they are your life! By obeying them you will enjoy a long life in the land you will occupy when you cross the Jordan River.”
<br>
<i><b>Moses’ Death Foretold</b></i> <br>
<sup>48</sup> That same day the Lord said to Moses, <sup>49</sup> “Go to Moab, to the mountains east of the river,[m] and climb Mount Nebo, which is across from Jericho. Look out across the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the people of Israel as their own special possession. <sup>50</sup> Then you will die there on the mountain. You will join your ancestors, just as Aaron, your brother, died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors. <sup>51</sup> For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh[n] in the wilderness of Zin. You failed to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel there. <sup>52</sup> So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>Moses Blesses the People</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the people of Israel before his death:

<sup>2</sup> “The Lord came from Mount Sinai
    and dawned upon us[a] from Mount Seir;
he shone forth from Mount Paran
    and came from Meribah-kadesh
    with flaming fire at his right hand.[b]
<sup>3</sup> Indeed, he loves his people;[c]
    all his holy ones are in his hands.
They follow in his steps
    and accept his teaching.
<sup>4</sup> Moses gave us the Lord’s instruction,
    the special possession of the people of Israel.[d]
<sup>5</sup> The Lord became king in Israel[e]—
    when the leaders of the people assembled,
    when the tribes of Israel gathered as one.”

<sup>6</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben:[f]

“Let the tribe of Reuben live and not die out,
    though they are few in number.”

<sup>7</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Judah:

“O Lord, hear the cry of Judah
    and bring them together as a people.
Give them strength to defend their cause;
    help them against their enemies!”

<sup>8</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Levi:

“O Lord, you have given your Thummim and Urim—the sacred lots—
    to your faithful servants the Levites.[g]
You put them to the test at Massah
    and struggled with them at the waters of Meribah.
<sup>9</sup> The Levites obeyed your word
    and guarded your covenant.
They were more loyal to you
    than to their own parents.
They ignored their relatives
    and did not acknowledge their own children.
<sup>10</sup> They teach your regulations to Jacob;
    they give your instructions to Israel.
They present incense before you
    and offer whole burnt offerings on the altar.
<sup>11</sup> Bless the ministry of the Levites, O Lord,
    and accept all the work of their hands.
Hit their enemies where it hurts the most;
    strike down their foes so they never rise again.”

<sup>12</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Benjamin:

“The people of Benjamin are loved by the Lord
    and live in safety beside him.
He surrounds them continuously
    and preserves them from every harm.”

<sup>13</sup> Moses said this about the tribes of Joseph:

“May their land be blessed by the Lord
    with the precious gift of dew from the heavens
    and water from beneath the earth;
<sup>14</sup> with the rich fruit that grows in the sun,
    and the rich harvest produced each month;
<sup>15</sup> with the finest crops of the ancient mountains,
    and the abundance from the everlasting hills;
<sup>16</sup> with the best gifts of the earth and its bounty,
    and the favor of the one who appeared in the burning bush.
May these blessings rest on Joseph’s head,
    crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers.
<sup>17</sup> Joseph has the majesty of a young bull;
    he has the horns of a wild ox.
He will gore distant nations,
    even to the ends of the earth.
This is my blessing for the multitudes of Ephraim
    and the thousands of Manasseh.”

<sup>18</sup> Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar[h]:

“May the people of Zebulun prosper in their travels.
    May the people of Issachar prosper at home in their tents.
<sup>19</sup> They summon the people to the mountain
    to offer proper sacrifices there.
They benefit from the riches of the sea
    and the hidden treasures in the sand.”

<sup>20</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Gad:

“Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad’s territory!
    Gad is poised there like a lion
    to tear off an arm or a head.
<sup>21</sup> The people of Gad took the best land for themselves;
    a leader’s share was assigned to them.
When the leaders of the people were assembled,
    they carried out the Lord’s justice
    and obeyed his regulations for Israel.”

<sup>22</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Dan:

“Dan is a lion’s cub,
    leaping out from Bashan.”

<sup>23</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Naphtali:

“O Naphtali, you are rich in favor
    and full of the Lord’s blessings;
    may you possess the west and the south.”

<sup>24</sup> Moses said this about the tribe of Asher:

“May Asher be blessed above other sons;
    may he be esteemed by his brothers;
    may he bathe his feet in olive oil.
<sup>25</sup> May the bolts of your gates be of iron and bronze;
    may you be secure all your days.”

<sup>26</sup> “There is no one like the God of Israel.[i]
    He rides across the heavens to help you,
    across the skies in majestic splendor.
<sup>27</sup> The eternal God is your refuge,
    and his everlasting arms are under you.
He drives out the enemy before you;
    he cries out, ‘Destroy them!’
<sup>28</sup> So Israel will live in safety,
    prosperous Jacob in security,
in a land of grain and new wine,
    while the heavens drop down dew.
<sup>29</sup> How blessed you are, O Israel!
    Who else is like you, a people saved by the Lord?
He is your protecting shield
    and your triumphant sword!
Your enemies will cringe before you,
    and you will stomp on their backs!”</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>The Death of Moses</b></i><br><sup>1</sup>Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah Peak, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him the whole land, from Gilead as far as Dan; <sup>2</sup> all the land of Naphtali; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; all the land of Judah, extending to the Mediterranean Sea[a]; <sup>3</sup> the Negev; the Jordan Valley with Jericho—the city of palms—as far as Zoar. <sup>4</sup> Then the Lord said to Moses, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have now allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you will not enter the land.”

<sup>5</sup> So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, just as the Lord had said. <sup>6</sup> The Lord buried him[b] in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab, but to this day no one knows the exact place. <sup>7</sup> Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was clear, and he was as strong as ever. <sup>8</sup> The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty days, until the customary period of mourning was over.

<sup>9</sup> Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him, doing just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

<sup>10</sup> There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face. <sup>11</sup> The Lord sent him to perform all the miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, and all his servants, and his entire land. <sup>12</sup> With mighty power, Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all Israel.</p>
