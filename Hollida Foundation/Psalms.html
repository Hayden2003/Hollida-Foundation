  <h1>Psalms</h1>

    <h3>Book One (Psalms 1-41)</h3>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p class="top-container">
    <sup>1</sup> Oh, the joys of those who do not
    follow the advice of the wicked,
    or stand around with sinners,
    or join in with mockers.
<sup>2</sup> But they delight in the law of the Lord,
    meditating on it day and night.
<sup>3</sup> They are like trees planted along the riverbank,
    bearing fruit each season.
Their leaves never wither,
    and they prosper in all they do.

<sup>4</sup> But not the wicked!
    They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.
<sup>5</sup> They will be condemned at the time of judgment.
    Sinners will have no place among the godly.
<sup>6</sup> For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,
    but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup> Why are the nations so angry?
    Why do they waste their time with futile plans?
<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth prepare for battle;
    the rulers plot together
against the Lord
    and against his anointed one.
<sup>3</sup> “Let us break their chains,” they cry,
    “and free ourselves from slavery to God.”

<sup>4</sup> But the one who rules in heaven laughs.
    The Lord scoffs at them.
<sup>5</sup> Then in anger he rebukes them,
    terrifying them with his fierce fury.
<sup>6</sup> For the Lord declares, “I have placed my chosen king on the throne
    in Jerusalem,[a] on my holy mountain.”

<sup>7</sup> The king proclaims the Lord’s decree:
“The Lord said to me, ‘You are my son.[b]
    Today I have become your Father.[c]
<sup>8</sup> Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
    the whole earth as your possession.
<sup>9</sup> You will break[d] them with an iron rod
    and smash them like clay pots.’”

<sup>10</sup> Now then, you kings, act wisely!
    Be warned, you rulers of the earth!
<sup>11</sup> Serve the Lord with reverent fear,
    and rejoice with trembling.
<sup>12</sup> Submit to God’s royal son,[e] or he will become angry,
    and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities—
for his anger flares up in an instant.
    But what joy for all who take refuge in him!</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of David, regarding the time David fled from his son Absalom.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, I have so many enemies;
    so many are against me.
<sup>2</sup> So many are saying,
    “God will never rescue him!” <i>Interlude[a]</i>

<sup>3</sup> But you, O Lord, are a shield around me;
    you are my glory, the one who holds my head high.
<sup>4</sup> I cried out to the Lord,
    and he answered me from his holy mountain. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>5</sup> I lay down and slept,
    yet I woke up in safety,
    for the Lord was watching over me.
<sup>6</sup> I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies
    who surround me on every side.

<sup>7</sup> Arise, O Lord!
    Rescue me, my God!
Slap all my enemies in the face!
    Shatter the teeth of the wicked!
<sup>8</sup> Victory comes from you, O Lord.
    May you bless your people. <i>Interlude</i> </p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by stringed instruments.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call to you,
    O God who declares me innocent.
Free me from my troubles.
    Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> How long will you people ruin my reputation?
    How long will you make groundless accusations?
    How long will you continue your lies? <i>Interlude</i>
<sup>3</sup> You can be sure of this:
    The Lord set apart the godly for himself.
    The Lord will answer when I call to him.

<sup>4</sup> Don’t sin by letting anger control you.
    Think about it overnight and remain silent. <i>Interlude</i>
<sup>5</sup> Offer sacrifices in the right spirit,
    and trust the Lord.

<sup>6</sup> Many people say, “Who will show us better times?”
    Let your face smile on us, Lord.
<sup>7</sup> You have given me greater joy
    than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine.
<sup>8</sup> In peace I will lie down and sleep,
    for you alone, O Lord, will keep me safe.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, hear me as I pray;
    pay attention to my groaning.
<sup>2</sup> Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God,
    for I pray to no one but you.
<sup>3</sup> Listen to my voice in the morning, Lord.
    Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly.

<sup>4</sup> O God, you take no pleasure in wickedness;
    you cannot tolerate the sins of the wicked.
<sup>5</sup> Therefore, the proud may not stand in your presence,
    for you hate all who do evil.
<sup>6</sup> You will destroy those who tell lies.
    The Lord detests murderers and deceivers.

<sup>7</sup> Because of your unfailing love, I can enter your house;
    I will worship at your Temple with deepest awe.
<sup>8</sup> Lead me in the right path, O Lord,
    or my enemies will conquer me.
Make your way plain for me to follow.

<sup>9</sup> My enemies cannot speak a truthful word.
    Their deepest desire is to destroy others.
Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave.
    Their tongues are filled with flattery.[a]
<sup>10</sup> O God, declare them guilty.
    Let them be caught in their own traps.
Drive them away because of their many sins,
    for they have rebelled against you.

<sup>11</sup> But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
    let them sing joyful praises forever.
Spread your protection over them,
    that all who love your name may be filled with joy.
<sup>12</sup> For you bless the godly, O Lord;
    you surround them with your shield of love.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by an eight-stringed instrument.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, don’t rebuke me in your anger
    or discipline me in your rage.
<sup>2</sup> Have compassion on me, Lord, for I am weak.
    Heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
<sup>3</sup> I am sick at heart.
    How long, O Lord, until you restore me?

<sup>4</sup> Return, O Lord, and rescue me.
    Save me because of your unfailing love.
<sup>5</sup> For the dead do not remember you.
    Who can praise you from the grave?[b]

<sup>6</sup> I am worn out from sobbing.
    All night I flood my bed with weeping,
    drenching it with my tears.
<sup>7</sup> My vision is blurred by grief;
    my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies.

<sup>8</sup> Go away, all you who do evil,
    for the Lord has heard my weeping.
<sup>9</sup> The Lord has heard my plea;
    the Lord will answer my prayer.
<sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified.
    May they suddenly turn back in shame.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm[a] of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush of the tribe of Benjamin.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I come to you for protection, O Lord my God.
    Save me from my persecutors—rescue me!
<sup>2</sup> If you don’t, they will maul me like a lion,
    tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
<sup>3</sup> O Lord my God, if I have done wrong
    or am guilty of injustice,
<sup>4</sup> if I have betrayed a friend
    or plundered my enemy without cause,
<sup>5</sup> then let my enemies capture me.
    Let them trample me into the ground
    and drag my honor in the dust. Interlude

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O Lord, in anger!
    Stand up against the fury of my enemies!
    Wake up, my God, and bring justice!
<sup>7</sup> Gather the nations before you.
    Rule over them from on high.
<sup>8</sup>     The Lord judges the nations.
Declare me righteous, O Lord,
    for I am innocent, O Most High!
<sup>9</sup> End the evil of those who are wicked,
    and defend the righteous.
For you look deep within the mind and heart,
    O righteous God.

<sup>10</sup> God is my shield,
    saving those whose hearts are true and right.
<sup>11</sup> God is an honest judge.
    He is angry with the wicked every day.

<sup>12</sup> If a person does not repent,
    God[b] will sharpen his sword;
    he will bend and string his bow.
<sup>13</sup> He will prepare his deadly weapons
    and shoot his flaming arrows.

<sup>14</sup> The wicked conceive evil;
    they are pregnant with trouble
    and give birth to lies.
<sup>15</sup> They dig a deep pit to trap others,
    then fall into it themselves.
<sup>16</sup> The trouble they make for others backfires on them.
    The violence they plan falls on their own heads.

<sup>17</sup> I will thank the Lord because he is just;
    I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.[a]</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!
    Your glory is higher than the heavens.
<sup>2</sup> You have taught children and infants
    to tell of your strength,[b]
silencing your enemies
    and all who oppose you.

<sup>3</sup> When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers—
    the moon and the stars you set in place—
<sup>4</sup> what are mere mortals that you should think about them,
    human beings that you should care for them?[c]
<sup>5</sup> Yet you made them only a little lower than God[d]
    and crowned them[e] with glory and honor.
<sup>6</sup> You gave them charge of everything you made,
    putting all things under their authority—
<sup>7</sup> the flocks and the herds
    and all the wild animals,
<sup>8</sup> the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea,
    and everything that swims the ocean currents.

<sup>9</sup> O Lord, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be sung to the tune “Death of the Son.”</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart;
    I will tell of all the marvelous things you have done.
<sup>2</sup> I will be filled with joy because of you.
    I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.

<sup>3</sup> My enemies retreated;
    they staggered and died when you appeared.
<sup>4</sup> For you have judged in my favor;
    from your throne you have judged with fairness.
<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
    you have erased their names forever.
<sup>6</sup> The enemy is finished, in endless ruins;
    the cities you uprooted are now forgotten.

<sup>7</sup> But the Lord reigns forever,
    executing judgment from his throne.
<sup>8</sup> He will judge the world with justice
    and rule the nations with fairness.
<sup>9</sup> The Lord is a shelter for the oppressed,
    a refuge in times of trouble.
<sup>10</sup> Those who know your name trust in you,
    for you, O Lord, do not abandon those who search for you.

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the Lord who reigns in Jerusalem.[a]
    Tell the world about his unforgettable deeds.
<sup>12</sup> For he who avenges murder cares for the helpless.
    He does not ignore the cries of those who suffer.

<sup>13</sup> Lord, have mercy on me.
    See how my enemies torment me.
    Snatch me back from the jaws of death.
<sup>14</sup> Save me so I can praise you publicly at Jerusalem’s gates,
    so I can rejoice that you have rescued me.

<sup>15</sup> The nations have fallen into the pit they dug for others.
    Their own feet have been caught in the trap they set.
<sup>16</sup> The Lord is known for his justice.
    The wicked are trapped by their own deeds. Quiet <i>Interlude[b]</i>

<sup>17</sup> The wicked will go down to the grave.[c]
    This is the fate of all the nations who ignore God.
<sup>18</sup> But the needy will not be ignored forever;
    the hopes of the poor will not always be crushed.

<sup>19</sup> Arise, O Lord!
    Do not let mere mortals defy you!
    Judge the nations!
<sup>20</sup> Make them tremble in fear, O Lord.
    Let the nations know they are merely human. <i>Interlude</i>

</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup> O Lord, why do you stand so far away?
    Why do you hide when I am in trouble?
<sup>2</sup> The wicked arrogantly hunt down the poor.
    Let them be caught in the evil they plan for others.
<sup>3</sup> For they brag about their evil desires;
    they praise the greedy and curse the Lord.

<sup>4</sup> The wicked are too proud to seek God.
    They seem to think that God is dead.
<sup>5</sup> Yet they succeed in everything they do.
    They do not see your punishment awaiting them.
    They sneer at all their enemies.
<sup>6</sup> They think, “Nothing bad will ever happen to us!
    We will be free of trouble forever!”

<sup>7</sup> Their mouths are full of cursing, lies, and threats.[a]
    Trouble and evil are on the tips of their tongues.
<sup>8</sup> They lurk in ambush in the villages,
    waiting to murder innocent people.
    They are always searching for helpless victims.
<sup>9</sup> Like lions crouched in hiding,
    they wait to pounce on the helpless.
Like hunters they capture the helpless
    and drag them away in nets.
<sup>10</sup> Their helpless victims are crushed;
    they fall beneath the strength of the wicked.
<sup>11</sup> The wicked think, “God isn’t watching us!
    He has closed his eyes and won’t even see what we do!”

<sup>12</sup> Arise, O Lord!
    Punish the wicked, O God!
    Do not ignore the helpless!
<sup>13</sup> Why do the wicked get away with despising God?
    They think, “God will never call us to account.”
<sup>14</sup> But you see the trouble and grief they cause.
    You take note of it and punish them.
The helpless put their trust in you.
    You defend the orphans.

<sup>15</sup> Break the arms of these wicked, evil people!
    Go after them until the last one is destroyed.
<sup>16</sup> The Lord is king forever and ever!
    The godless nations will vanish from the land.
<sup>17</sup> Lord, you know the hopes of the helpless.
    Surely you will hear their cries and comfort them.
<sup>18</sup> You will bring justice to the orphans and the oppressed,
    so mere people can no longer terrify them.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I trust in the Lord for protection.
So why do you say to me,
    “Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety!
<sup>2</sup> The wicked are stringing their bows
    and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings.
They shoot from the shadows
    at those whose hearts are right.
<sup>3</sup> The foundations of law and order have collapsed.
    What can the righteous do?”

<sup>4</sup> But the Lord is in his holy Temple;
    the Lord still rules from heaven.
He watches everyone closely,
    examining every person on earth.
<sup>5</sup> The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked.
    He hates those who love violence.
<sup>6</sup> He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked,
    punishing them with scorching winds.
<sup>7</sup> For the righteous Lord loves justice.
    The virtuous will see his face.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by an eight-stringed instrument.[a]</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Help, O Lord, for the godly are fast disappearing!
    The faithful have vanished from the earth!
<sup>2</sup> Neighbors lie to each other,
    speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.
<sup>3</sup> May the Lord cut off their flattering lips
    and silence their boastful tongues.
<sup>4</sup> They say, “We will lie to our hearts’ content.
    Our lips are our own—who can stop us?”

<sup>5</sup> The Lord replies, “I have seen violence done to the helpless,
    and I have heard the groans of the poor.
Now I will rise up to rescue them,
    as they have longed for me to do.”
<sup>6</sup> The Lord’s promises are pure,
    like silver refined in a furnace,
    purified seven times over.
<sup>7</sup> Therefore, Lord, we know you will protect the oppressed,
    preserving them forever from this lying generation,
<sup>8</sup> even though the wicked strut about,
    and evil is praised throughout the land.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, how long will you forget me? Forever?
    How long will you look the other way?
<sup>2</sup> How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul,
    with sorrow in my heart every day?
    How long will my enemy have the upper hand?

<sup>3</sup> Turn and answer me, O Lord my God!
    Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die.
<sup>4</sup> Don’t let my enemies gloat, saying, “We have defeated him!”
    Don’t let them rejoice at my downfall.

<sup>5</sup> But I trust in your unfailing love.
    I will rejoice because you have rescued me.
<sup>6</sup> I will sing to the Lord
    because he is good to me.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Only fools say in their hearts,
    “There is no God.”
They are corrupt, and their actions are evil;
    not one of them does good!

<sup>2</sup> The Lord looks down from heaven
    on the entire human race;
he looks to see if anyone is truly wise,
    if anyone seeks God.
<sup>3</sup> But no, all have turned away;
    all have become corrupt.[a]
No one does good,
    not a single one!

<sup>4</sup> Will those who do evil never learn?
    They eat up my people like bread
    and wouldn’t think of praying to the Lord.
<sup>5</sup> Terror will grip them,
    for God is with those who obey him.
<sup>6</sup> The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed,
    but the Lord will protect his people.

<sup>7</sup> Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel?
    When the Lord restores his people,
    Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Who may worship in your sanctuary, Lord?
    Who may enter your presence on your holy hill?
<sup>2</sup> Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right,
    speaking the truth from sincere hearts.
<sup>3</sup> Those who refuse to gossip
    or harm their neighbors
    or speak evil of their friends.
<sup>4</sup> Those who despise flagrant sinners,
    and honor the faithful followers of the Lord,
    and keep their promises even when it hurts.
<sup>5</sup> Those who lend money without charging interest,
    and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent.
Such people will stand firm forever.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm[a] of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Keep me safe, O God,
    for I have come to you for refuge.

<sup>2</sup> I said to the Lord, “You are my Master!
    Every good thing I have comes from you.”
<sup>3</sup> The godly people in the land
    are my true heroes!
    I take pleasure in them!
<sup>4</sup> Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods.
    I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood
    or even speak the names of their gods.

<sup>5</sup> Lord, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing.
    You guard all that is mine.
<sup>6</sup> The land you have given me is a pleasant land.
    What a wonderful inheritance!

<sup>7</sup> I will bless the Lord who guides me;
    even at night my heart instructs me.
<sup>8</sup> I know the Lord is always with me.
    I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.

<sup>9</sup> No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice.[b]
    My body rests in safety.
<sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul among the dead[c]
    or allow your holy one[d] to rot in the grave.
<sup>11</sup> You will show me the way of life,
    granting me the joy of your presence
    and the pleasures of living with you forever.[e]</p>

    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A prayer of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, hear my plea for justice.
    Listen to my cry for help.
Pay attention to my prayer,
    for it comes from honest lips.
<sup>2</sup> Declare me innocent,
    for you see those who do right.

<sup>3</sup> You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night.
    You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong.
    I am determined not to sin in what I say.
<sup>4</sup> I have followed your commands,
    which keep me from following cruel and evil people.
<sup>5</sup> My steps have stayed on your path;
    I have not wavered from following you.

<sup>6</sup> I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God.
    Bend down and listen as I pray.
<sup>7</sup> Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways.
    By your mighty power you rescue
    those who seek refuge from their enemies.
<sup>8</sup> Guard me as you would guard your own eyes.[a]
    Hide me in the shadow of your wings.
<sup>9</sup> Protect me from wicked people who attack me,
    from murderous enemies who surround me.
<sup>10</sup> They are without pity.
    Listen to their boasting!
<sup>11</sup> They track me down and surround me,
    watching for the chance to throw me to the ground.
<sup>12</sup> They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart—
    like young lions hiding in ambush.

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O Lord!
    Stand against them, and bring them to their knees!
    Rescue me from the wicked with your sword!
<sup>14</sup> By the power of your hand, O Lord,
    destroy those who look to this world for their reward.
But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones.
    May their children have plenty,
    leaving an inheritance for their descendants.
<sup>15</sup> Because I am righteous, I will see you.
    When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord. He sang this song to the Lord on the day the Lord rescued him from all his enemies and from Saul. He sang:</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I love you, Lord;
    you are my strength.
<sup>2</sup> The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my savior;
    my God is my rock, in whom I find protection.
He is my shield, the power that saves me,
    and my place of safety.
<sup>3</sup> I called on the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
    and he saved me from my enemies.

<sup>4</sup> The ropes of death entangled me;
    floods of destruction swept over me.
<sup>5</sup> The grave[a] wrapped its ropes around me;
    death laid a trap in my path.
<sup>6</sup> But in my distress I cried out to the Lord;
    yes, I prayed to my God for help.
He heard me from his sanctuary;
    my cry to him reached his ears.

<sup>7</sup> Then the earth quaked and trembled.
    The foundations of the mountains shook;
    they quaked because of his anger.
<sup>8</sup> Smoke poured from his nostrils;
    fierce flames leaped from his mouth.
    Glowing coals blazed forth from him.
<sup>9</sup> He opened the heavens and came down;
    dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.
<sup>10</sup> Mounted on a mighty angelic being,[b] he flew,
    soaring on the wings of the wind.
<sup>11</sup> He shrouded himself in darkness,
    veiling his approach with dark rain clouds.
<sup>12</sup> Thick clouds shielded the brightness around him
    and rained down hail and burning coals.[c]
<sup>13</sup> The Lord thundered from heaven;
    the voice of the Most High resounded
    amid the hail and burning coals.
<sup>14</sup> He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies;
    great bolts of lightning flashed, and they were confused.
<sup>15</sup> Then at your command, O Lord,
    at the blast of your breath,
the bottom of the sea could be seen,
    and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.

<sup>16</sup> He reached down from heaven and rescued me;
    he drew me out of deep waters.
<sup>17</sup> He rescued me from my powerful enemies,
    from those who hated me and were too strong for me.
<sup>18</sup> They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress,
    but the Lord supported me.
<sup>19</sup> He led me to a place of safety;
    he rescued me because he delights in me.
<sup>20</sup> The Lord rewarded me for doing right;
    he restored me because of my innocence.
<sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of the Lord;
    I have not turned from my God to follow evil.
<sup>22</sup> I have followed all his regulations;
    I have never abandoned his decrees.
<sup>23</sup> I am blameless before God;
    I have kept myself from sin.
<sup>24</sup> The Lord rewarded me for doing right.
    He has seen my innocence.

<sup>25</sup> To the faithful you show yourself faithful;
    to those with integrity you show integrity.
<sup>26</sup> To the pure you show yourself pure,
    but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
<sup>27</sup> You rescue the humble,
    but you humiliate the proud.
<sup>28</sup> You light a lamp for me.
    The Lord, my God, lights up my darkness.
<sup>29</sup> In your strength I can crush an army;
    with my God I can scale any wall.

<sup>30</sup> God’s way is perfect.
    All the Lord’s promises prove true.
    He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.
<sup>31</sup> For who is God except the Lord?
    Who but our God is a solid rock?
<sup>32</sup> God arms me with strength,
    and he makes my way perfect.
<sup>33</sup> He makes me as surefooted as a deer,
    enabling me to stand on mountain heights.
<sup>34</sup> He trains my hands for battle;
    he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.
<sup>35</sup> You have given me your shield of victory.
    Your right hand supports me;
    your help[d] has made me great.
<sup>36</sup> You have made a wide path for my feet
    to keep them from slipping.

<sup>37</sup> I chased my enemies and caught them;
    I did not stop until they were conquered.
<sup>38</sup> I struck them down so they could not get up;
    they fell beneath my feet.
<sup>39</sup> You have armed me with strength for the battle;
    you have subdued my enemies under my feet.
<sup>40</sup> You placed my foot on their necks.
    I have destroyed all who hated me.
<sup>41</sup> They called for help, but no one came to their rescue.
    They even cried to the Lord, but he refused to answer.
<sup>42</sup> I ground them as fine as dust in the wind.
    I swept them into the gutter like dirt.
<sup>43</sup> You gave me victory over my accusers.
    You appointed me ruler over nations;
    people I don’t even know now serve me.
<sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me, they submit;
    foreign nations cringe before me.
<sup>45</sup> They all lose their courage
    and come trembling from their strongholds.

<sup>46</sup> The Lord lives! Praise to my Rock!
    May the God of my salvation be exalted!
<sup>47</sup> He is the God who pays back those who harm me;
    he subdues the nations under me
<sup>48</sup>     and rescues me from my enemies.
You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies;
    you save me from violent opponents.
<sup>49</sup> For this, O Lord, I will praise you among the nations;
    I will sing praises to your name.
<sup>50</sup> You give great victories to your king;
    you show unfailing love to your anointed,
    to David and all his descendants forever.</p>

    night after night they make him known.
<sup>3</sup> They speak without a sound or word;
    their voice is never heard.[a]
<sup>4</sup> Yet their message has gone throughout the earth,
    and their words to all the world.

God has made a home in the heavens for the sun.
<sup>5</sup> It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding.
    It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.

They are sweeter than honey,
    even honey dripping from the comb.
<sup>11</sup> They are a warning to your servant,
    a great reward for those who obey them.

<sup>12</sup> How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart?
    Cleanse me from these hidden faults.
<sup>13</sup> Keep your servant from deliberate sins!
    Don’t let them control me.
Then I will be free of guilt
    and innocent of great sin.

<sup>2</sup> Every day I call to you, my God, but you do not answer.
    Every night I lift my voice, but I find no relief.

    You are my strength; come quickly to my aid!
<sup>20</sup> Save me from the sword;
    spare my precious life from these dogs.

<sup>3</sup> Though a mighty army surrounds me,
    my heart will not be afraid.
Even if I am attacked,

    the thing I seek most—
is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
    delighting in the Lord’s perfections
    and meditating in his Temple.

    You have always been my helper.
Don’t leave me now; don’t abandon me,

    Lead me along the right path,

those who speak friendly words to their neighbors
    while planning evil in their hearts.
<sup>4</sup> Give them the punishment they so richly deserve!
    Measure it out in proportion to their wickedness.
Pay them back for all their evil deeds!
    Give them a taste of what they have done to others.

    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm[a] of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Oh, what joy for those
    whose disobedience is forgiven,
    whose sin is put out of sight!
<sup>2</sup> Yes, what joy for those
    whose record the Lord has cleared of guilt,[b]
    whose lives are lived in complete honesty!
<sup>3</sup> When I refused to confess my sin,
    my body wasted away,
    and I groaned all day long.
<sup>4</sup> Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me.
    My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>5</sup> Finally, I confessed all my sins to you
    and stopped trying to hide my guilt.
I said to myself, “I will confess my rebellion to the Lord.”
    And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>6</sup> Therefore, let all the godly pray to you while there is still time,
    that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgment.
<sup>7</sup> For you are my hiding place;
    you protect me from trouble.
    You surround me with songs of victory. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>8</sup> The Lord says, “I will guide you along the best pathway for your life.
    I will advise you and watch over you.
<sup>9</sup> Do not be like a senseless horse or mule
    that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control.”

<sup>10</sup> Many sorrows come to the wicked,
    but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the Lord.
<sup>11</sup> So rejoice in the Lord and be glad, all you who obey him!
    Shout for joy, all you whose hearts are pure!</p>

    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup> Let the godly sing for joy to the Lord;
    it is fitting for the pure to praise him.
<sup>2</sup> Praise the Lord with melodies on the lyre;
    make music for him on the ten-stringed harp.
<sup>3</sup> Sing a new song of praise to him;
    play skillfully on the harp, and sing with joy.
<sup>4</sup> For the word of the Lord holds true,
    and we can trust everything he does.
<sup>5</sup> He loves whatever is just and good;
    the unfailing love of the Lord fills the earth.

<sup>6</sup> The Lord merely spoke,
    and the heavens were created.
He breathed the word,
    and all the stars were born.
<sup>7</sup> He assigned the sea its boundaries
    and locked the oceans in vast reservoirs.
<sup>8</sup> Let the whole world fear the Lord,
    and let everyone stand in awe of him.
<sup>9</sup> For when he spoke, the world began!
    It appeared at his command.

<sup>10</sup> The Lord frustrates the plans of the nations
    and thwarts all their schemes.
<sup>11</sup> But the Lord’s plans stand firm forever;
    his intentions can never be shaken.

<sup>12</sup> What joy for the nation whose God is the Lord,
    whose people he has chosen as his inheritance.

<sup>13</sup> The Lord looks down from heaven
    and sees the whole human race.
<sup>14</sup> From his throne he observes
    all who live on the earth.
<sup>15</sup> He made their hearts,
    so he understands everything they do.
<sup>16</sup> The best-equipped army cannot save a king,
    nor is great strength enough to save a warrior.
<sup>17</sup> Don’t count on your warhorse to give you victory—
    for all its strength, it cannot save you.

<sup>18</sup> But the Lord watches over those who fear him,
    those who rely on his unfailing love.
<sup>19</sup> He rescues them from death
    and keeps them alive in times of famine.

<sup>20</sup> We put our hope in the Lord.
    He is our help and our shield.
<sup>21</sup> In him our hearts rejoice,
    for we trust in his holy name.
<sup>22</sup> Let your unfailing love surround us, Lord,
    for our hope is in you alone.</p>

    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of David, regarding the time he pretended to be insane in front of Abimelech, who sent him away.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I will praise the Lord at all times.
    I will constantly speak his praises.
<sup>2</sup> I will boast only in the Lord;
    let all who are helpless take heart.
<sup>3</sup> Come, let us tell of the Lord’s greatness;
    let us exalt his name together.

<sup>4</sup> I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me.
    He freed me from all my fears.
<sup>5</sup> Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy;
    no shadow of shame will darken their faces.
<sup>6</sup> In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened;
    he saved me from all my troubles.
<sup>7</sup> For the angel of the Lord is a guard;
    he surrounds and defends all who fear him.

<sup>8</sup> Taste and see that the Lord is good.
    Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!
<sup>9</sup> Fear the Lord, you his godly people,
    for those who fear him will have all they need.
<sup>10</sup> Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry,
    but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.

<sup>11</sup> Come, my children, and listen to me,
    and I will teach you to fear the Lord.
<sup>12</sup> Does anyone want to live a life
    that is long and prosperous?
<sup>13</sup> Then keep your tongue from speaking evil
    and your lips from telling lies!
<sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do good.
    Search for peace, and work to maintain it.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right;
    his ears are open to their cries for help.
<sup>16</sup> But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil;
    he will erase their memory from the earth.
<sup>17</sup> The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.
    He rescues them from all their troubles.
<sup>18</sup> The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;
    he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

<sup>19</sup> The righteous person faces many troubles,
    but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.
<sup>20</sup> For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous;
    not one of them is broken!

<sup>21</sup> Calamity will surely destroy the wicked,
    and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
<sup>22</sup> But the Lord will redeem those who serve him.
    No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.</p>

    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, oppose those who oppose me.
    Fight those who fight against me.

    Prepare for battle, and come to my aid.
<sup>3</sup> Lift up your spear and javelin
    against those who pursue me.
Let me hear you say,
    “I will give you victory!”
<sup>4</sup> Bring shame and disgrace on those trying to kill me;
    turn them back and humiliate those who want to harm me.
<sup>5</sup> Blow them away like chaff in the wind—
    a wind sent by the angel of the Lord.
<sup>6</sup> Make their path dark and slippery,
    with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
<sup>7</sup> I did them no wrong, but they laid a trap for me.
    I did them no wrong, but they dug a pit to catch me.
<sup>8</sup> So let sudden ruin come upon them!
    Let them be caught in the trap they set for me!
    Let them be destroyed in the pit they dug for me.

<sup>9</sup> Then I will rejoice in the Lord.
    I will be glad because he rescues me.
<sup>10</sup> With every bone in my body I will praise him:
    “Lord, who can compare with you?
Who else rescues the helpless from the strong?
    Who else protects the helpless and poor from those who rob them?”

<sup>11</sup> Malicious witnesses testify against me.
    They accuse me of crimes I know nothing about.
<sup>12</sup> They repay me evil for good.
    I am sick with despair.
<sup>13</sup> Yet when they were ill, I grieved for them.
    I denied myself by fasting for them,
    but my prayers returned unanswered.
<sup>14</sup> I was sad, as though they were my friends or family,
    as if I were grieving for my own mother.
<sup>15</sup> But they are glad now that I am in trouble;
    they gleefully join together against me.
I am attacked by people I don’t even know;
    they slander me constantly.
<sup>16</sup> They mock me and call me names;
    they snarl at me.

<sup>17</sup> How long, O Lord, will you look on and do nothing?
    Rescue me from their fierce attacks.
    Protect my life from these lions!
<sup>18</sup> Then I will thank you in front of the great assembly.
    I will praise you before all the people.
<sup>19</sup> Don’t let my treacherous enemies rejoice over my defeat.
    Don’t let those who hate me without cause gloat over my sorrow.
<sup>20</sup> They don’t talk of peace;
    they plot against innocent people who mind their own business.
<sup>21</sup> They shout, “Aha! Aha!
    With our own eyes we saw him do it!”

<sup>22</sup> O Lord, you know all about this.
    Do not stay silent.
    Do not abandon me now, O Lord.
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Rise to my defense!
    Take up my case, my God and my Lord.
<sup>24</sup> Declare me not guilty, O Lord my God, for you give justice.
    Don’t let my enemies laugh about me in my troubles.
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let them say, “Look, we got what we wanted!
    Now we will eat him alive!”

<sup>26</sup> May those who rejoice at my troubles
    be humiliated and disgraced.
May those who triumph over me
    be covered with shame and dishonor.
<sup>27</sup> But give great joy to those who came to my defense.
    Let them continually say, “Great is the Lord,
    who delights in blessing his servant with peace!”
<sup>28</sup> Then I will proclaim your justice,
    and I will praise you all day long.</p>

<sup>1</sup> Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts.[a]
    They have no fear of God at all.
<sup>2</sup> In their blind conceit,
    they cannot see how wicked they really are.
<sup>3</sup> Everything they say is crooked and deceitful.
    They refuse to act wisely or do good.
<sup>4</sup> They lie awake at night, hatching sinful plots.
    Their actions are never good.
    They make no attempt to turn from evil.

<sup>5</sup> Your unfailing love, O Lord, is as vast as the heavens;
    your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds.
<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,
    your justice like the ocean depths.
You care for people and animals alike, O Lord.
<sup>7</sup>     How precious is your unfailing love, O God!
All humanity finds shelter
    in the shadow of your wings.
<sup>8</sup> You feed them from the abundance of your own house,
    letting them drink from your river of delights.
<sup>9</sup> For you are the fountain of life,
    the light by which we see.

<sup>10</sup> Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you;
    give justice to those with honest hearts.
<sup>11</sup> Don’t let the proud trample me
    or the wicked push me around.
<sup>12</sup> Look! Those who do evil have fallen!
    They are thrown down, never to rise again.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 37</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of David.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t worry about the wicked
    or envy those who do wrong.
<sup>2</sup> For like grass, they soon fade away.
    Like spring flowers, they soon wither.

<sup>3</sup> Trust in the Lord and do good.
    Then you will live safely in the land and prosper.
<sup>4</sup> Take delight in the Lord,
    and he will give you your heart’s desires.

<sup>5</sup> Commit everything you do to the Lord.
    Trust him, and he will help you.
<sup>6</sup> He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn,
    and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.

<sup>7</sup> Be still in the presence of the Lord,
    and wait patiently for him to act.
Don’t worry about evil people who prosper
    or fret about their wicked schemes.

<sup>8</sup> Stop being angry!
    Turn from your rage!
Do not lose your temper—
    it only leads to harm.
<sup>9</sup> For the wicked will be destroyed,
    but those who trust in the Lord will possess the land.

<sup>10</sup> Soon the wicked will disappear.
    Though you look for them, they will be gone.
<sup>11</sup> The lowly will possess the land
    and will live in peace and prosperity.

<sup>12</sup> The wicked plot against the godly;
    they snarl at them in defiance.
<sup>13</sup> But the Lord just laughs,
    for he sees their day of judgment coming.

<sup>14</sup> The wicked draw their swords
    and string their bows
to kill the poor and the oppressed,
    to slaughter those who do right.
<sup>15</sup> But their swords will stab their own hearts,
    and their bows will be broken.

<sup>16</sup> It is better to be godly and have little
    than to be evil and rich.
<sup>17</sup> For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,
    but the Lord takes care of the godly.

<sup>18</sup> Day by day the Lord takes care of the innocent,
    and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.
<sup>19</sup> They will not be disgraced in hard times;
    even in famine they will have more than enough.

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked will die.
    The Lord’s enemies are like flowers in a field—
    they will disappear like smoke.

<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow and never repay,
    but the godly are generous givers.
<sup>22</sup> Those the Lord blesses will possess the land,
    but those he curses will die.

<sup>23</sup> The Lord directs the steps of the godly.
    He delights in every detail of their lives.
<sup>24</sup> Though they stumble, they will never fall,
    for the Lord holds them by the hand.

<sup>25</sup> Once I was young, and now I am old.
    Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned
    or their children begging for bread.
<sup>26</sup> The godly always give generous loans to others,
    and their children are a blessing.

<sup>27</sup> Turn from evil and do good,
    and you will live in the land forever.
<sup>28</sup> For the Lord loves justice,
    and he will never abandon the godly.

He will keep them safe forever,
    but the children of the wicked will die.
<sup>29</sup> The godly will possess the land
    and will live there forever.

<sup>30</sup> The godly offer good counsel;
    they teach right from wrong.
<sup>31</sup> They have made God’s law their own,
    so they will never slip from his path.

<sup>32</sup> The wicked wait in ambush for the godly,
    looking for an excuse to kill them.
<sup>33</sup> But the Lord will not let the wicked succeed
    or let the godly be condemned when they are put on trial.

<sup>34</sup> Put your hope in the Lord.
    Travel steadily along his path.
He will honor you by giving you the land.
    You will see the wicked destroyed.

<sup>35</sup> I have seen wicked and ruthless people
    flourishing like a tree in its native soil.
<sup>36</sup> But when I looked again, they were gone!
    Though I searched for them, I could not find them!

<sup>37</sup> Look at those who are honest and good,
    for a wonderful future awaits those who love peace.
<sup>38</sup> But the rebellious will be destroyed;
    they have no future.

<sup>39</sup> The Lord rescues the godly;
    he is their fortress in times of trouble.
<sup>40</sup> The Lord helps them,
    rescuing them from the wicked.
He saves them,
    and they find shelter in him.</p>

<sup>1</sup> O God, we have heard it with our own ears—
    our ancestors have told us
of all you did in their day,
    in days long ago:
<sup>2</sup> You drove out the pagan nations by your power
    and gave all the land to our ancestors.
You crushed their enemies
    and set our ancestors free.
<sup>3</sup> They did not conquer the land with their swords;
    it was not their own strong arm that gave them victory.
It was your right hand and strong arm
    and the blinding light from your face that helped them,
    for you loved them.

<sup>4</sup> You are my King and my God.
    You command victories for Israel.[b]
<sup>5</sup> Only by your power can we push back our enemies;
    only in your name can we trample our foes.
<sup>6</sup> I do not trust in my bow;
    I do not count on my sword to save me.
<sup>7</sup> You are the one who gives us victory over our enemies;
    you disgrace those who hate us.
<sup>8</sup> O God, we give glory to you all day long
    and constantly praise your name. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>9</sup> But now you have tossed us aside in dishonor.
    You no longer lead our armies to battle.
<sup>10</sup> You make us retreat from our enemies
    and allow those who hate us to plunder our land.
<sup>11</sup> You have butchered us like sheep
    and scattered us among the nations.
<sup>12</sup> You sold your precious people for a pittance,
    making nothing on the sale.
<sup>13</sup> You let our neighbors mock us.
    We are an object of scorn and derision to those around us.
<sup>14</sup> You have made us the butt of their jokes;
    they shake their heads at us in scorn.
<sup>15</sup> We can’t escape the constant humiliation;
    shame is written across our faces.
<sup>16</sup> All we hear are the taunts of our mockers.
    All we see are our vengeful enemies.

<sup>17</sup> All this has happened though we have not forgotten you.
    We have not violated your covenant.
<sup>18</sup> Our hearts have not deserted you.
    We have not strayed from your path.
<sup>19</sup> Yet you have crushed us in the jackal’s desert home.
    You have covered us with darkness and death.
<sup>20</sup> If we had forgotten the name of our God
    or spread our hands in prayer to foreign gods,
<sup>21</sup> God would surely have known it,
    for he knows the secrets of every heart.
<sup>22</sup> But for your sake we are killed every day;
    we are being slaughtered like sheep.

<sup>23</sup> Wake up, O Lord! Why do you sleep?
    Get up! Do not reject us forever.
<sup>24</sup> Why do you look the other way?
    Why do you ignore our suffering and oppression?
<sup>25</sup> We collapse in the dust,
    lying face down in the dirt.
<sup>26</sup> Rise up! Help us!
    Ransom us because of your unfailing love.</p>

    where I can always hide.
Give the order to save me,
    for you are my rock and my fortress.
<sup>4</sup> My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked,
    from the clutches of cruel oppressors.
<sup>5</sup> O Lord, you alone are my hope.
    I’ve trusted you, O Lord, from childhood.
<sup>6</sup> Yes, you have been with me from birth;
    from my mother’s womb you have cared for me.
    No wonder I am always praising you!

<sup>7</sup> My life is an example to many,
    because you have been my strength and protection.
<sup>8</sup> That is why I can never stop praising you;
    I declare your glory all day long.
<sup>9</sup> And now, in my old age, don’t set me aside.
    Don’t abandon me when my strength is failing.
<sup>10</sup> For my enemies are whispering against me.
    They are plotting together to kill me.
<sup>11</sup> They say, “God has abandoned him.
    Let’s go and get him,
    for no one will help him now.”

<sup>12</sup> O God, don’t stay away.
    My God, please hurry to help me.
<sup>13</sup> Bring disgrace and destruction on my accusers.
    Humiliate and shame those who want to harm me.
<sup>14</sup> But I will keep on hoping for your help;
    I will praise you more and more.
<sup>15</sup> I will tell everyone about your righteousness.
    All day long I will proclaim your saving power,
    though I am not skilled with words.[a]
<sup>16</sup> I will praise your mighty deeds, O Sovereign Lord.
    I will tell everyone that you alone are just.

<sup>17</sup> O God, you have taught me from my earliest childhood,
    and I constantly tell others about the wonderful things you do.
<sup>18</sup> Now that I am old and gray,
    do not abandon me, O God.
Let me proclaim your power to this new generation,
    your mighty miracles to all who come after me.

<sup>19</sup> Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the highest heavens.
    You have done such wonderful things.
    Who can compare with you, O God?
<sup>20</sup> You have allowed me to suffer much hardship,
    but you will restore me to life again
    and lift me up from the depths of the earth.
<sup>21</sup> You will restore me to even greater honor
    and comfort me once again.

<sup>22</sup> Then I will praise you with music on the harp,
    because you are faithful to your promises, O my God.
I will sing praises to you with a lyre,
    O Holy One of Israel.
<sup>23</sup> I will shout for joy and sing your praises,
    for you have ransomed me.
<sup>24</sup> I will tell about your righteous deeds
    all day long,
for everyone who tried to hurt me
    has been shamed and humiliated.</p>

<sup>1</sup> Give your love of justice to the king, O God,

<h3>Book Three (73-89)</h3>
<h2>Chapter 73</h2>
<p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm of Asaph.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> Truly God is good to Israel,
    to those whose hearts are pure.
<sup>2</sup> But as for me, I almost lost my footing.
    My feet were slipping, and I was almost gone.
<sup>3</sup> For I envied the proud
    when I saw them prosper despite their wickedness.
<sup>4</sup> They seem to live such painless lives;
    their bodies are so healthy and strong.
<sup>5</sup> They don’t have troubles like other people;
    they’re not plagued with problems like everyone else.
<sup>6</sup> They wear pride like a jeweled necklace
    and clothe themselves with cruelty.
<sup>7</sup> These fat cats have everything
    their hearts could ever wish for!
<sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak only evil;
    in their pride they seek to crush others.
<sup>9</sup> They boast against the very heavens,
    and their words strut throughout the earth.
<sup>10</sup> And so the people are dismayed and confused,
    drinking in all their words.
<sup>11</sup> “What does God know?” they ask.
    “Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”
<sup>12</sup> Look at these wicked people—
    enjoying a life of ease while their riches multiply.

<sup>13</sup> Did I keep my heart pure for nothing?
    Did I keep myself innocent for no reason?
<sup>14</sup> I get nothing but trouble all day long;
    every morning brings me pain.

<sup>15</sup> If I had really spoken this way to others,
    I would have been a traitor to your people.
<sup>16</sup> So I tried to understand why the wicked prosper.
    But what a difficult task it is!
<sup>17</sup> Then I went into your sanctuary, O God,
    and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked.
<sup>18</sup> Truly, you put them on a slippery path
    and send them sliding over the cliff to destruction.
<sup>19</sup> In an instant they are destroyed,
    completely swept away by terrors.
<sup>20</sup> When you arise, O Lord,
    you will laugh at their silly ideas
    as a person laughs at dreams in the morning.

<sup>21</sup> Then I realized that my heart was bitter,
    and I was all torn up inside.
<sup>22</sup> I was so foolish and ignorant—
    I must have seemed like a senseless animal to you.
<sup>23</sup> Yet I still belong to you;
    you hold my right hand.
<sup>24</sup> You guide me with your counsel,
    leading me to a glorious destiny.
<sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but you?
    I desire you more than anything on earth.
<sup>26</sup> My health may fail, and my spirit may grow weak,
    but God remains the strength of my heart;
    he is mine forever.

<sup>27</sup> Those who desert him will perish,
    for you destroy those who abandon you.
<sup>28</sup> But as for me, how good it is to be near God!
    I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter,
    and I will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 74</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm[a] of Asaph.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O God, why have you rejected us so long?
    Why is your anger so intense against the sheep of your own pasture?
<sup>2</sup> Remember that we are the people you chose long ago,
    the tribe you redeemed as your own special possession!
    And remember Jerusalem,[b] your home here on earth.
<sup>3</sup> Walk through the awful ruins of the city;
    see how the enemy has destroyed your sanctuary.

<sup>4</sup> There your enemies shouted their victorious battle cries;
    there they set up their battle standards.
<sup>5</sup> They swung their axes
    like woodcutters in a forest.
<sup>6</sup> With axes and picks,
    they smashed the carved paneling.
<sup>7</sup> They burned your sanctuary to the ground.
    They defiled the place that bears your name.
<sup>8</sup> Then they thought, “Let’s destroy everything!”
    So they burned down all the places where God was worshiped.

<sup>9</sup> We no longer see your miraculous signs.
    All the prophets are gone,
    and no one can tell us when it will end.
<sup>10</sup> How long, O God, will you allow our enemies to insult you?
    Will you let them dishonor your name forever?
<sup>11</sup> Why do you hold back your strong right hand?
    Unleash your powerful fist and destroy them.

<sup>12</sup> You, O God, are my king from ages past,
    bringing salvation to the earth.
<sup>13</sup> You split the sea by your strength
    and smashed the heads of the sea monsters.
<sup>14</sup> You crushed the heads of Leviathan[c]
    and let the desert animals eat him.
<sup>15</sup> You caused the springs and streams to gush forth,
    and you dried up rivers that never run dry.
<sup>16</sup> Both day and night belong to you;
    you made the starlight[d] and the sun.
<sup>17</sup> You set the boundaries of the earth,
    and you made both summer and winter.

<sup>18</sup> See how these enemies insult you, Lord.
    A foolish nation has dishonored your name.
<sup>19</sup> Don’t let these wild beasts destroy your turtledoves.
    Don’t forget your suffering people forever.

<sup>20</sup> Remember your covenant promises,
    for the land is full of darkness and violence!
<sup>21</sup> Don’t let the downtrodden be humiliated again.
    Instead, let the poor and needy praise your name.

<sup>22</sup> Arise, O God, and defend your cause.
    Remember how these fools insult you all day long.
<sup>23</sup> Don’t overlook what your enemies have said
    or their growing uproar.</p>

    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of Asaph. A song to be sung to the tune “Do Not Destroy!”</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> We thank you, O God!
    We give thanks because you are near.
    People everywhere tell of your wonderful deeds.

<sup>2</sup> God says, “At the time I have planned,
    I will bring justice against the wicked.
<sup>3</sup> When the earth quakes and its people live in turmoil,
    I am the one who keeps its foundations firm. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>4</sup> “I warned the proud, ‘Stop your boasting!’
    I told the wicked, ‘Don’t raise your fists!
<sup>5</sup> Don’t raise your fists in defiance at the heavens
    or speak with such arrogance.’”
<sup>6</sup> For no one on earth—from east or west,
    or even from the wilderness—
    should raise a defiant fist.[a]
<sup>7</sup> It is God alone who judges;
    he decides who will rise and who will fall.
<sup>8</sup> For the Lord holds a cup in his hand
    that is full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
He pours out the wine in judgment,
    and all the wicked must drink it,
    draining it to the dregs.

<sup>9</sup> But as for me, I will always proclaim what God has done;
    I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
<sup>10</sup> For God says, “I will break the strength of the wicked,
    but I will increase the power of the godly.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 76</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For the choir director: A psalm of Asaph. A song to be accompanied by stringed instruments.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> God is honored in Judah;
    his name is great in Israel.
<sup>2</sup> Jerusalem[a] is where he lives;
    Mount Zion is his home.
<sup>3</sup> There he has broken the fiery arrows of the enemy,
    the shields and swords and weapons of war. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>4</sup> You are glorious and more majestic
    than the everlasting mountains.[b]
<sup>5</sup> Our boldest enemies have been plundered.
    They lie before us in the sleep of death.
    No warrior could lift a hand against us.
<sup>6</sup> At the blast of your breath, O God of Jacob,
    their horses and chariots lay still.

<sup>7</sup> No wonder you are greatly feared!
    Who can stand before you when your anger explodes?
<sup>8</sup> From heaven you sentenced your enemies;
    the earth trembled and stood silent before you.
<sup>9</sup> You stand up to judge those who do evil, O God,
    and to rescue the oppressed of the earth. <i>Interlude</i>
<sup>10</sup> Human defiance only enhances your glory,
    for you use it as a weapon.[c]

<sup>11</sup> Make vows to the Lord your God, and keep them.
    Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One.
<sup>12</sup> For he breaks the pride of princes,
    and the kings of the earth fear him.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 77</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of Asaph.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> I cry out to God; yes, I shout.
    Oh, that God would listen to me!
<sup>2</sup> When I was in deep trouble,
    I searched for the Lord.
All night long I prayed, with hands lifted toward heaven,
    but my soul was not comforted.
<sup>3</sup> I think of God, and I moan,
    overwhelmed with longing for his help. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>4</sup> You don’t let me sleep.
    I am too distressed even to pray!
<sup>5</sup> I think of the good old days,
    long since ended,
<sup>6</sup> when my nights were filled with joyful songs.
    I search my soul and ponder the difference now.
<sup>7</sup> Has the Lord rejected me forever?
    Will he never again be kind to me?
<sup>8</sup> Is his unfailing love gone forever?
    Have his promises permanently failed?
<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious?
    Has he slammed the door on his compassion? <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>10</sup> And I said, “This is my fate;
    the Most High has turned his hand against me.”
<sup>11</sup> But then I recall all you have done, O Lord;
    I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago.
<sup>12</sup> They are constantly in my thoughts.
    I cannot stop thinking about your mighty works.

<sup>13</sup> O God, your ways are holy.
    Is there any god as mighty as you?
<sup>14</sup> You are the God of great wonders!
    You demonstrate your awesome power among the nations.
<sup>15</sup> By your strong arm, you redeemed your people,
    the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. <i>Interlude</i>

<sup>16</sup> When the Red Sea[a] saw you, O God,
    its waters looked and trembled!
    The sea quaked to its very depths.
<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured down rain;
    the thunder rumbled in the sky.
    Your arrows of lightning flashed.
<sup>18</sup> Your thunder roared from the whirlwind;
    the lightning lit up the world!
    The earth trembled and shook.
<sup>19</sup> Your road led through the sea,
    your pathway through the mighty waters—
    a pathway no one knew was there!
<sup>20</sup> You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep,
    with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 78</h2>
    <p class="top-container"><i><b>A psalm[a] of Asaph.</b></i><br>
<sup>1</sup> O my people, listen to my instructions.
    Open your ears to what I am saying,
<sup>2</sup>     for I will speak to you in a parable.
I will teach you hidden lessons from our past—
<sup>3</sup>     stories we have heard and known,
    stories our ancestors handed down to us.
<sup>4</sup> We will not hide these truths from our children;
    we will tell the next generation
about the glorious deeds of the Lord,
    about his power and his mighty wonders.
<sup>5</sup> For he issued his laws to Jacob;
    he gave his instructions to Israel.
He commanded our ancestors
    to teach them to their children,
<sup>6</sup> so the next generation might know them—
    even the children not yet born—
    and they in turn will teach their own children.
<sup>7</sup> So each generation should set its hope anew on God,
    not forgetting his glorious miracles
    and obeying his commands.
<sup>8</sup> Then they will not be like their ancestors—
    stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful,
    refusing to give their hearts to God.

<sup>9</sup> The warriors of Ephraim, though armed with bows,
    turned their backs and fled on the day of battle.
<sup>10</sup> They did not keep God’s covenant
    and refused to live by his instructions.
<sup>11</sup> They forgot what he had done—
    the great wonders he had shown them,
<sup>12</sup> the miracles he did for their ancestors
    on the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.
<sup>13</sup> For he divided the sea and led them through,
    making the water stand up like walls!
<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he led them by a cloud,
    and all night by a pillar of fire.
<sup>15</sup> He split open the rocks in the wilderness
    to give them water, as from a gushing spring.
<sup>16</sup> He made streams pour from the rock,
    making the waters flow down like a river!

<sup>17</sup> Yet they kept on sinning against him,
    rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
<sup>18</sup> They stubbornly tested God in their hearts,
    demanding the foods they craved.
<sup>19</sup> They even spoke against God himself, saying,
    “God can’t give us food in the wilderness.
<sup>20</sup> Yes, he can strike a rock so water gushes out,
    but he can’t give his people bread and meat.”
<sup>21</sup> When the Lord heard them, he was furious.
    The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob.
    Yes, his anger rose against Israel,
<sup>22</sup> for they did not believe God
    or trust him to care for them.
<sup>23</sup> But he commanded the skies to open;
    he opened the doors of heaven.
<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna for them to eat;
    he gave them bread from heaven.
<sup>25</sup> They ate the food of angels!
    God gave them all they could hold.
<sup>26</sup> He released the east wind in the heavens
    and guided the south wind by his mighty power.
<sup>27</sup> He rained down meat as thick as dust—
    birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore!
<sup>28</sup> He caused the birds to fall within their camp
    and all around their tents.
<sup>29</sup> The people ate their fill.
    He gave them what they craved.
<sup>30</sup> But before they satisfied their craving,
    while the meat was yet in their mouths,
<sup>31</sup> the anger of God rose against them,
    and he killed their strongest men.
    He struck down the finest of Israel’s young men.

<sup>32</sup> But in spite of this, the people kept sinning.
    Despite his wonders, they refused to trust him.
<sup>33</sup> So he ended their lives in failure,
    their years in terror.
<sup>34</sup> When God began killing them,
    they finally sought him.
    They repented and took God seriously.
<sup>35</sup> Then they remembered that God was their rock,
    that God Most High[b] was their redeemer.
<sup>36</sup> But all they gave him was lip service;
    they lied to him with their tongues.
<sup>37</sup> Their hearts were not loyal to him.
    They did not keep his covenant.
<sup>38</sup> Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins
    and did not destroy them all.
Many times he held back his anger
    and did not unleash his fury!
<sup>39</sup> For he remembered that they were merely mortal,
    gone like a breath of wind that never returns.

<sup>40</sup> Oh, how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
    and grieved his heart in that dry wasteland.
<sup>41</sup> Again and again they tested God’s patience
    and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
<sup>42</sup> They did not remember his power
    and how he rescued them from their enemies.
<sup>43</sup> They did not remember his miraculous signs in Egypt,
    his wonders on the plain of Zoan.
<sup>44</sup> For he turned their rivers into blood,
    so no one could drink from the streams.
<sup>45</sup> He sent vast swarms of flies to consume them
    and hordes of frogs to ruin them.
<sup>46</sup> He gave their crops to caterpillars;
    their harvest was consumed by locusts.
<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their grapevines with hail
    and shattered their sycamore-figs with sleet.
<sup>48</sup> He abandoned their cattle to the hail,
    their livestock to bolts of lightning.
<sup>49</sup> He loosed on them his fierce anger—
    all his fury, rage, and hostility.
He dispatched against them
    a band of destroying angels.
<sup>50</sup> He turned his anger against them;
    he did not spare the Egyptians’ lives
    but ravaged them with the plague.
<sup>51</sup> He killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family,
    the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt.[c]
<sup>52</sup> But he led his own people like a flock of sheep,
    guiding them safely through the wilderness.
<sup>53</sup> He kept them safe so they were not afraid;
    but the sea covered their enemies.
<sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his holy land,
    to this land of hills he had won for them.
<sup>55</sup> He drove out the nations before them;
    he gave them their inheritance by lot.
    He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes.

<sup>56</sup> But they kept testing and rebelling against God Most High.
    They did not obey his laws.
<sup>57</sup> They turned back and were as faithless as their parents.
    They were as undependable as a crooked bow.
<sup>58</sup> They angered God by building shrines to other gods;
    they made him jealous with their idols.
<sup>59</sup> When God heard them, he was very angry,
    and he completely rejected Israel.
<sup>60</sup> Then he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh,
    the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people.
<sup>61</sup> He allowed the Ark of his might to be captured;
    he surrendered his glory into enemy hands.
<sup>62</sup> He gave his people over to be butchered by the sword,
    because he was so angry with his own people—his special possession.
<sup>63</sup> Their young men were killed by fire;
    their young women died before singing their wedding songs.
<sup>64</sup> Their priests were slaughtered,
    and their widows could not mourn their deaths.

<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord rose up as though waking from sleep,
    like a warrior aroused from a drunken stupor.
<sup>66</sup> He routed his enemies
    and sent them to eternal shame.
<sup>67</sup> But he rejected Joseph’s descendants;
    he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
<sup>68</sup> He chose instead the tribe of Judah,
    and Mount Zion, which he loved.
<sup>69</sup> There he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens,
    as solid and enduring as the earth.
<sup>70</sup> He chose his servant David,
    calling him from the sheep pens.
<sup>71</sup> He took David from tending the ewes and lambs
    and made him the shepherd of Jacob’s descendants—
    God’s own people, Israel.
<sup>72</sup> He cared for them with a true heart
    and led them with skillful hands.</p>

    leaders whose decrees permit injustice?

    and condemn the innocent to death.

O Lord my God, how great you are!

You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;
<sup>3</sup>     you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.
You make the clouds your chariot;
    you ride upon the wings of the wind.
<sup>4</sup> The winds are your messengers;
    flames of fire are your servants.[a]

<sup>5</sup> You placed the world on its foundation
    so it would never be moved.
<sup>6</sup> You clothed the earth with floods of water,
    water that covered even the mountains.
<sup>7</sup> At your command, the water fled;
    at the sound of your thunder, it hurried away.
<sup>8</sup> Mountains rose and valleys sank
    to the levels you decreed.
<sup>9</sup> Then you set a firm boundary for the seas,
    so they would never again cover the earth.

<sup>10</sup> You make springs pour water into the ravines,
    so streams gush down from the mountains.
<sup>11</sup> They provide water for all the animals,
    and the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
<sup>12</sup> The birds nest beside the streams
    and sing among the branches of the trees.
<sup>13</sup> You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home,
    and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor.
<sup>14</sup> You cause grass to grow for the livestock
    and plants for people to use.
You allow them to produce food from the earth—
<sup>15</sup>     wine to make them glad,
olive oil to soothe their skin,
    and bread to give them strength.
<sup>16</sup> The trees of the Lord are well cared for—
    the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
<sup>17</sup> There the birds make their nests,
    and the storks make their homes in the cypresses.
<sup>18</sup> High in the mountains live the wild goats,
    and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes.[b]

<sup>19</sup> You made the moon to mark the seasons,
    and the sun knows when to set.
<sup>20</sup> You send the darkness, and it becomes night,
    when all the forest animals prowl about.
<sup>21</sup> Then the young lions roar for their prey,
    stalking the food provided by God.
<sup>22</sup> At dawn they slink back
    into their dens to rest.
<sup>23</sup> Then people go off to their work,
    where they labor until evening.

<sup>24</sup> O Lord, what a variety of things you have made!
    In wisdom you have made them all.
    The earth is full of your creatures.
<sup>25</sup> Here is the ocean, vast and wide,
    teeming with life of every kind,
    both large and small.
<sup>26</sup> See the ships sailing along,
    and Leviathan,[c] which you made to play in the sea.

<sup>27</sup> They all depend on you
    to give them food as they need it.
<sup>28</sup> When you supply it, they gather it.
    You open your hand to feed them,
    and they are richly satisfied.

    When you take away their breath,
    they die and turn again to dust.

    you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<sup>7</sup> He is the Lord our God.
    His justice is seen throughout the land.
<sup>8</sup> He always stands by his covenant—
    the commitment he made to a thousand generations.
<sup>9</sup> This is the covenant he made with Abraham
    and the oath he swore to Isaac.
<sup>10</sup> He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
    and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant:
<sup>11</sup> “I will give you the land of Canaan
    as your special possession.”

<sup>12</sup> He said this when they were few in number,
    a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.
<sup>13</sup> They wandered from nation to nation,
    from one kingdom to another.
<sup>14</sup> Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.
    He warned kings on their behalf:
<sup>15</sup> “Do not touch my chosen people,
    and do not hurt my prophets.”

<sup>16</sup> He called for a famine on the land of Canaan,
    cutting off its food supply.
<sup>17</sup> Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them—
    Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
<sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with fetters
    and placed his neck in an iron collar.
<sup>19</sup> Until the time came to fulfill his dreams,[a]
    the Lord tested Joseph’s character.
<sup>20</sup> Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free;
    the ruler of the nation opened his prison door.
<sup>21</sup> Joseph was put in charge of all the king’s household;
    he became ruler over all the king’s possessions.
<sup>22</sup> He could instruct[b] the king’s aides as he pleased
    and teach the king’s advisers.

<sup>23</sup> Then Israel arrived in Egypt;
    Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.

    until they became too mighty for their enemies.
<sup>25</sup> Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,
    and they plotted against the Lord’s servants.

<sup>26</sup> But the Lord sent his servant Moses,
    along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.
<sup>27</sup> They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,
    and wonders in the land of Ham.
<sup>28</sup> The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness,
    for they had defied[c] his commands to let his people go.
<sup>29</sup> He turned their water into blood,
    poisoning all the fish.
<sup>30</sup> Then frogs overran the land
    and even invaded the king’s bedrooms.
<sup>31</sup> When the Lord spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians,
    and gnats swarmed across Egypt.
<sup>32</sup> He sent them hail instead of rain,
    and lightning flashed over the land.
<sup>33</sup> He ruined their grapevines and fig trees
    and shattered all the trees.
<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and hordes of locusts came—
    young locusts beyond number.
<sup>35</sup> They ate up everything green in the land,
    destroying all the crops in their fields.
<sup>36</sup> Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home,
    the pride and joy of each family.

<sup>37</sup> The Lord brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold;
    and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.
<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they were gone,
    for they feared them greatly.
<sup>39</sup> The Lord spread a cloud above them as a covering
    and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.
<sup>40</sup> They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;
    he satisfied their hunger with manna—bread from heaven.
<sup>41</sup> He split open a rock, and water gushed out
    to form a river through the dry wasteland.
<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his sacred promise
    to his servant Abraham.
<sup>43</sup> So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,
    his chosen ones with rejoicing.
<sup>44</sup> He gave his people the lands of pagan nations,
    and they harvested crops that others had planted.
<sup>45</sup> All this happened so they would follow his decrees
    and obey his instructions.

    to defend the honor of his name
    and to demonstrate his mighty power.
<sup>9</sup> He commanded the Red Sea[b] to dry up.
    He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert.
<sup>10</sup> So he rescued them from their enemies
    and redeemed them from their foes.

    testing God’s patience in that dry wasteland.
<sup>15</sup> So he gave them what they asked for,
    but he sent a plague along with it.
<sup>16</sup> The people in the camp were jealous of Moses
    and envious of Aaron, the Lord’s holy priest.
<sup>17</sup> Because of this, the earth opened up;
    it swallowed Dathan
    and buried Abiram and the other rebels.

    for a statue of a grass-eating bull.
<sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their savior,
    who had done such great things in Egypt—
<sup>22</sup>such wonderful things in the land of Ham,
    such awesome deeds at the Red Sea.
<sup>23</sup> So he declared he would destroy them.
    But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the Lord and the people.
    He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them.

<sup>24</sup> The people refused to enter the pleasant land,
    for they wouldn’t believe his promise to care for them.
<sup>25</sup> Instead, they grumbled in their tents
    and refused to obey the Lord.
<sup>26</sup> Therefore, he solemnly swore
    that he would kill them in the wilderness,
<sup>27</sup> that he would scatter their descendants[d] among the nations,
    exiling them to distant lands.

<sup>28</sup> Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor;
    they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!
<sup>29</sup> They angered the Lord with all these things,
    so a plague broke out among them.
<sup>30</sup> But Phinehas had the courage to intervene,
    and the plague was stopped.
<sup>31</sup> So he has been regarded as a righteous man
    ever since that time.

<sup>32</sup> At Meribah, too, they angered the Lord,
    causing Moses serious trouble.
<sup>33</sup> They made Moses angry,[e]
    and he spoke foolishly.

<sup>34</sup> Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land,
    as the Lord had commanded them.
<sup>35</sup> Instead, they mingled among the pagans
    and adopted their evil customs.
<sup>36</sup> They worshiped their idols,
    which led to their downfall.
<sup>37</sup> They even sacrificed their sons
    and their daughters to the demons.
<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood,
    the blood of their sons and daughters.
By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan,
    they polluted the land with murder.
<sup>39</sup> They defiled themselves by their evil deeds,
    and their love of idols was adultery in the Lord’s sight.

<sup>40</sup> That is why the Lord’s anger burned against his people,
    and he abhorred his own special possession.
<sup>41</sup> He handed them over to pagan nations,
    and they were ruled by those who hated them.
<sup>42</sup> Their enemies crushed them
    and brought them under their cruel power.
<sup>43</sup> Again and again he rescued them,
    but they chose to rebel against him,
    and they were finally destroyed by their sin.
<sup>44</sup> Even so, he pitied them in their distress
    and listened to their cries.
<sup>45</sup> He remembered his covenant with them
    and relented because of his unfailing love.
<sup>46</sup> He even caused their captors
    to treat them with kindness.

<sup>47</sup> Save us, O Lord our God!
    Gather us back from among the nations,
so we can thank your holy name
    and rejoice and praise you.

<sup>48</sup> Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
    who lives from everlasting to everlasting!
Let all the people say, “Amen!”

Praise the Lord!</p>

<h2>Chapter 107</h2>
<p class="top-container">
<h3>Book Five (Psalms 107-150)</h3>
  <sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever.
<sup>2</sup> Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out!
    Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.
<sup>3</sup> For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,
    from east and west,
    from north and south.[a]

<sup>4</sup> Some wandered in the wilderness,
    lost and homeless.
<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,
    they nearly died.
<sup>6</sup> “Lord, help!” they cried in their trouble,
    and he rescued them from their distress.
<sup>7</sup> He led them straight to safety,
    to a city where they could live.
<sup>8</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
<sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the thirsty
    and fills the hungry with good things.

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom,
    imprisoned in iron chains of misery.
<sup>11</sup> They rebelled against the words of God,
    scorning the counsel of the Most High.
<sup>12</sup> That is why he broke them with hard labor;
    they fell, and no one was there to help them.
<sup>13</sup> “Lord, help!” they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.
<sup>14</sup> He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom;
    he snapped their chains.
<sup>15</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
<sup>16</sup> For he broke down their prison gates of bronze;
    he cut apart their bars of iron.

<sup>17</sup> Some were fools; they rebelled
    and suffered for their sins.
<sup>18</sup> They couldn’t stand the thought of food,
    and they were knocking on death’s door.
<sup>19</sup> “Lord, help!” they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.
<sup>20</sup> He sent out his word and healed them,
    snatching them from the door of death.
<sup>21</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
<sup>22</sup> Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
    and sing joyfully about his glorious acts.

<sup>23</sup> Some went off to sea in ships,
    plying the trade routes of the world.
<sup>24</sup> They, too, observed the Lord’s power in action,
    his impressive works on the deepest seas.
<sup>25</sup> He spoke, and the winds rose,
    stirring up the waves.
<sup>26</sup> Their ships were tossed to the heavens
    and plunged again to the depths;
    the sailors cringed in terror.
<sup>27</sup> They reeled and staggered like drunkards
    and were at their wits’ end.
<sup>28</sup> “Lord, help!” they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.
<sup>29</sup> He calmed the storm to a whisper
    and stilled the waves.
<sup>30</sup> What a blessing was that stillness
    as he brought them safely into harbor!
<sup>31</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation
    and before the leaders of the nation.

<sup>33</sup> He changes rivers into deserts,
    and springs of water into dry, thirsty land.
<sup>34</sup> He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands,
    because of the wickedness of those who live there.
<sup>35</sup> But he also turns deserts into pools of water,
    the dry land into springs of water.
<sup>36</sup> He brings the hungry to settle there
    and to build their cities.
<sup>37</sup> They sow their fields, plant their vineyards,
    and harvest their bumper crops.
<sup>38</sup> How he blesses them!
    They raise large families there,
    and their herds of livestock increase.

<sup>39</sup> When they decrease in number and become impoverished
    through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
<sup>40</sup> the Lord pours contempt on their princes,
    causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.
<sup>41</sup> But he rescues the poor from trouble
    and increases their families like flocks of sheep.
<sup>42</sup> The godly will see these things and be glad,
    while the wicked are struck silent.
<sup>43</sup> Those who are wise will take all this to heart;
    they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord.</p>

    Who will bring me victory over Edom?

    he persecuted the poor and needy,
    and he hounded the brokenhearted to death.
<sup>17</sup> He loved to curse others;
    now you curse him.
He never blessed others;
    now don’t you bless him.

Rescue me
    because you are so faithful and good.
<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy,
    and my heart is full of pain.
<sup>23</sup> I am fading like a shadow at dusk;
    I am brushed off like a locust.
<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak from fasting,
    and I am skin and bones.
<sup>25</sup> I am a joke to people everywhere;
    when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.

    Save me because of your unfailing love.

    let us worship at the footstool of his throne.
<sup>8</sup> Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place,
    along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.
<sup>9</sup> May your priests be clothed in godliness;
    may your loyal servants sing for joy.
<sup>10</sup> For the sake of your servant David,
    do not reject the king you have anointed.

    with a promise he will never take back:
“I will place one of your descendants
    on your throne.
<sup>12</sup> If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant
    and the laws that I teach them,
then your royal line
    will continue forever and ever.”

<sup>2</sup> For harmony is as precious as the anointing oil
    that was poured over Aaron’s head,
    that ran down his beard
    and onto the border of his robe.
<sup>3</sup> Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon
    that falls on the mountains of Zion.
And there the Lord has pronounced his blessing,

<p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord!

Praise God in his sanctuary;
    praise him in his mighty heaven!
<sup>2</sup> Praise him for his mighty works;
    praise his unequaled greatness!
<sup>3</sup> Praise him with a blast of the ram’s horn;
    praise him with the lyre and harp!
<sup>4</sup> Praise him with the tambourine and dancing;
    praise him with strings and flutes!
<sup>5</sup> Praise him with a clash of cymbals;
    praise him with loud clanging cymbals.
<sup>6</sup> Let everything that breathes sing praises to the Lord!

Praise the Lord!</p>
